What percentage less did John sell the PlayStation for?", "answer": "20\\%", "solution": "Let's calculate the total cost John had to pay for the computer and accessories:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of computer + Cost of accessories\nTotal cost = $700 + $200\nTotal cost = $900\n\nJohn sold his PlayStation for some percentage less than its value and paid $580 out of his pocket. So, the amount he got from selling the PlayStation is the difference between the total cost and the amount he paid out of his pocket:\n\nAmount from PlayStation sale = Total cost - Amount paid out of pocket\nAmount from PlayStation sale = $900 - $580\nAmount from PlayStation sale = $320\n\nNow, let's find out the percentage less he sold the PlayStation for. The PlayStation was worth $400, but he sold it for $320. The difference in price is:\n\nDifference in price = Original value of PlayStation - Sale price of PlayStation\nDifference in price = $400 - $320\nDifference in price = $80\n\nTo find the percentage less, we divide the difference in price by the original value of the PlayStation and multiply by 100:\n\nPercentage less = (Difference in price / Original value of PlayStation) * 100\nPercentage less = ($80 / $400) * 100\nPercentage less = 0.2 * 100\nPercentage less = 20%\n\nJohn sold his PlayStation for $\\boxed{20\\%}$  less than its value."}

By the trident lemma,\n\n$CI = CB = CD = 2$. We can reason in different ways from here.\n\nFirst method. Let $K$ and $N$ be the feet of the perpendiculars dropped from points $C$ and $I$ to $BD$ and $AD$ respectively (left figure). Then, from the equality of the right triangles $BKC$ and $ANI$, it follows that $CK = IN$. The perpendicular $IP$ to the diagonal $BD$ is also equal to $IN$ (these are the radii of the inscribed circle of triangle $ABD$), so $BD$ intersects the segment $CI$ at its midpoint $L$. Thus, $CL = IL = 1$.\n\nBy the theorem on the product of segments of chords, $BL \\cdot DL = AL \\cdot CL$. Let $BL = x$ and $DL = y$, then $xy = 3$. By the Cauchy inequality, the minimum value of the sum $x + y$ is achieved when $x = y = \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the value $BD = 2\\sqrt{3}$ is the smallest possible.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_5ff42d6d57f9dccbb1f5g-02.jpg?height=788&width=1156&top_left_y=2038&top_left_x=473)\n\nSecond method. By Ptolemy's theorem (see problem 52468), $AD \\cdot BC + AB \\cdot CD = AC \\cdot BD$, that is, $2AD + 2AB = 4BD$. Therefore, $BD = \\frac{1}{2}(AB + AD)$ (a triangle $ABD$ with this property is called a difference triangle).\n\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume that $AB \\geq AD$. Draw a circle with center $C$ and radius 2, which intersects side $AB$ at point $E$ (right figure). The angle bisector $AC$ of angle $BAD$ is its axis of symmetry and the axis of symmetry of the angle, so points $E$ and $D$ are symmetric with respect to $AC$. Therefore, $AE = AD$.\n\nBy the theorem on the product of segments of secants, $AE \\cdot AB = AI \\cdot AF$ (IF is the diameter of the constructed circle).\n\nTherefore, $AD \\cdot AB = 2 \\cdot 6 = 12$.\n\nBy the Cauchy inequality, $BD = \\frac{1}{2}(AB + AD) \\geq \\sqrt{AB \\cdot AD} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.

If we denote the exponent of 2 in $n$ as $t(n)$, then $t(100) = t(252)$. Since the losing state $(0,0)$ satisfies $t(0) = t(0) = \\infty$, the winning state $(r, 0)$ satisfies $t(r)2^{k} = t(n)$, i.e., $t(m-r) \\neq t(n)$.\n\nIf $t(m) \\neq t(n)$, let $t(m) = k, t(n) = r (k > r)$, then the player can take $2^{r}$ matches from the pile with $m$ matches, resulting in the state $\\left(m-2^{r}, n\\right)$.

A circle rolls along the side $BC$ of the triangle; $O$ is its center at some position, and $K$ is the point of tangency of side $BC$ with the circle; sides $AB$ and $AC$ intercept arc $MKN$ on the circle (Fig. 279). The line $OA$ is the axis of symmetry of the figure; therefore, sides $AB'$ and $AC'$ intercept arc $M'N'$ on the circle, equal to arc $MKN$. The angle $A$, containing $60^\\circ$, is measured by the half-sum of arcs $MN$ and $M'N'$; hence, each of these arcs contains $60^\\circ$.

Therefore, to show that the shaded lens on the diagram always remains inside the triangle $ABC$, we need to show that the angles $AMN$ and $ANM$ always remain at least $30^\\circ$.

But $OP$ passes through the point $K$ of tangency of the $\\Delta$-deltoid with side $BC$, so the perpendiculars $MP$, $NP$, and $KP$ to the sides of $\\triangle ABC$ intersect at one point.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_03412fca680f64158016g-307.jpg?height=314&width=455&top_left_y=392&top_left_x=131)\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_03412fca680f64158016g-307.jpg?height=379&width=431&top_left_y=1099&top_left_x=196)\n\na)\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_03412fca680f64158016g-307.jpg?height=288&width=296&top_left_y=1156&top_left_x=725)\n\nb)\n\nFig. 281.\n\nNow let's find the geometric locus of points $P$. The diameter $AP$ of the circle $MPNOA$ does not depend on the position of the $\\Delta$-deltoid inside the equilateral triangle.\n\nIndeed, the chord $MN$ of constant length (the chord of the lens) subtends an arc of $120^\\circ$ in this circle. It is not difficult to see that the diameter of this circle is equal to the side of the triangle $ABC$: indeed, when $OP$ passes through point $C$, then $P$ coincides with $C$ and $AP$ coincides with $AC$. Thus, $AP$ is equal to $AC$, or, in other words, the distance from point $P$ to the vertex of the triangle $ABC$ lying on the other side of segment $MN$ is always equal to the side of the triangle. The geometric locus described by point $P$ as the $\\Delta$-deltoid rotates inside the equilateral triangle is shown in Fig. 281, a).\n\nObviously, $\\angle MPN = 180^\\circ - \\angle MAN = 120^\\circ$ (see Fig. 280). Therefore, the geometric locus described by point $P$ as the equilateral triangle rotates, always remaining circumscribed around a fixed $\\Delta$-deltoid, has the shape shown in Fig. 281, b)."}

These will be exactly the passengers traveling from stop number \\(i \\leqslant 7\\) to stop number \\(j \\geqslant 8\\). Let's take a \\(7 \\times 7\\) square, the rows of which are numbered by the numbers \\(1, \\ldots, 7\\), and the columns by the numbers \\(8, \\ldots, 14\\). If there is a passenger in the bus traveling from stop number \\(i \\leqslant 7\\) to stop number \\(j \\geqslant 8\\), we will mark the cell at the intersection of the \\(i\\)-th row and the \\(j\\)-th column. The number of marked cells, by condition, is no more than 25, so there are at least \\(24=4 \\cdot 6\\) unmarked cells.\n\nWe will prove that in the specified \\(7 \\times 7\\) square, we can select rows \\(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{4}\\) and columns \\(B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{4}\\) such that the cell at the intersection of row \\(A_{i}\\) and column \\(B_{j}\\) is unmarked. First, we will prove that we can select one row and one column such that the cell at their intersection is unmarked, and after their deletion, at least \\(15=3 \\cdot 5\\) unmarked cells remain. If in each column and in each row there are no more than 5 unmarked cells, we can take any unmarked cell and select the row and column containing it. Indeed, in this case, the selected row and column contain no more than 9 unmarked cells. If in some row (column) there are 6 unmarked cells, then among the columns (rows) passing through the unmarked cells of this row (column), there will be a column (row) with no more than 4 unmarked points. We can select these row and column. If in some row (column) all cells are unmarked, then there will be a column (row) with no more than 3 unmarked points. We can select these row and column.\n\nSimilarly, we can prove that in the resulting \\(6 \\times 6\\) square, we can select a row and a column such that the cell at their intersection is unmarked, and after their deletion, at least \\(8=2 \\cdot 4\\) unmarked cells remain. Then, in the resulting \\(6 \\times 6\\) square, we can select a row and a column such that the cell at their intersection is unmarked, and after their deletion, at least \\(3=1 \\cdot 3\\) unmarked cells remain (it is sufficient for at least one unmarked cell to remain).\n\nb) Suppose that from each stop with numbers \\(1,2, \\ldots, 10\\) to each other stop with these numbers, exactly one passenger travels, and then the bus travels empty.

{"id": "15ad089a-4c66-4d0f-8e05-94fb878ca54d", "question": "1. In a tennis tournament, there are $2^{n}+4$ schoolchildren participating, where $n-$ is a natural number greater than 4. A win earns 1 point, and a loss earns 0 points. Before each round, pairs are formed by drawing lots from participants who have the same number of points (those who do not find a pair skip the round). The tournament ends as soon as a sole leader is determined. How many schoolchildren will have 3 points after the tournament ends?", "answer": "C_{n}^{3}+1", "solution": "Answer: $C_{n}^{3}+1$.\n\nSolution. First, let's prove two statements.\n\n1) In a tournament with $2^{n}$ participants, there will never be a player without a pair, and by the end of the tournament, for any $k \\in\\{0, \\ldots, n\\}$, $C_{n}^{k}$ students will have $k$ points. We will use induction on $n$. For $n=1$, everything is obvious. Suppose that for some $n$ both statements are true. Then, in a tournament with $2^{n+1}$ participants, after the first round, $2^{n}$ students will have 0 points and $2^{n}$ students will have 1 point. We will continue to conduct the draw so that participants from these groups only meet each other. By the inductive hypothesis, this can always be done, and such an assumption will obviously not affect the distribution of points. In other words, we will further conduct two independent tournaments with $2^{n}$ participants. By the inductive hypothesis, there will be no players without a pair in these tournaments. Moreover, in the first tournament, $C_{n}^{k}$ students will have $k$ points, and in the second tournament, $C_{n}^{k-1}$ students will have $k$ points, since all participants started with one point. In the end, $C_{n}^{k}+C_{n}^{k-1}=C_{n+1}^{k}$ students will have $k$ points (we used the main identity of Pascal's triangle). Thus, the inductive step is completed.\n2) The tournament can be reduced to two independent tournaments in groups of $2^{n}$ and 4 people. Indeed, in each round, we will only pair participants from the same group. By 1), all participants in the first group can be paired. Therefore, if someone is left without a pair in the overall tournament, we can assume that this participant is from the second group. At the end of the tournament, the results of the two groups are simply combined.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of participants who scored 3 points in the tournament. By 1), in the first group, there will be $C_{n}^{3}$ such participants. The dynamics of the distribution of points among participants from the second group are as follows:\n\n$$\n4 \\rightarrow(2,2) \\rightarrow(1,2,1) \\rightarrow(1,1,2) \\rightarrow(1,1,1,1)\n$$\n\n(the left number represents the number of underdogs, the right number represents the number of leaders). After the fourth round, participants from the second group have no one to play with, so at the end of the tournament, one participant will have 3 points. Thus, the answer is the sum of $C_{n}^{3}$ and 1."}

It can cross the bridge in 60 seconds. The second train, Train B, is 800 meters long and travels at 70 km / hr. How long is the bridge, such that both trains can successfully cross it without any collision? Assume that Train A and Train B are traveling in the same direction, and they start crossing at different ends at the same time.", "answer": "200.2", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train will travel before they meet, and then we can determine the length of the bridge.\n\nFirst, let's convert the speeds of the trains from km/hr to m/s to match the units of the lengths of the trains and the bridge.\n\nSpeed of Train A in m/s = 42 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 42 * 1000 / 3600 = 11.67 m/s\n\nSpeed of Train B in m/s = 70 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 70 * 1000 / 3600 = 19.44 m/s\n\nNow, let's calculate the distance Train A travels in 60 seconds since it can cross the bridge in that time.\n\nDistance Train A travels in 60 seconds = Speed of Train A * Time\n= 11.67 m/s * 60 s\n= 700.2 m\n\nThis distance includes the length of Train A and the bridge. Therefore, the length of the bridge is:\n\nLength of the bridge = Distance Train A travels in 60 seconds - Length of Train A\n= 700.2 m - 500 m\n= 200.2 m\n\nNow, we need to ensure that Train B can also cross the bridge without colliding with Train A. Since both trains start at the same time from opposite ends, we need to find the point where they meet.\n\nThe relative speed at which they approach each other is the sum of their individual speeds:\n\nRelative speed = Speed of Train A + Speed of Train B\n= 11.67 m/s + 19.44 m/s\n= 31.11 m/s\n\nThe total length they need to cover before meeting is the sum of the lengths of both trains and the bridge:\n\nTotal length to cover = Length of Train A + Length of Train B + Length of the bridge\n= 500 m + 800 m + 200.2 m\n= 1500.2 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the time it takes for them to meet:\n\nTime to meet = Total length to cover / Relative speed\n= 1500.2 m / 31.11 m/s\n= 48.22 seconds (approximately)\n\nSince they meet in approximately 48.22 seconds, which is less than 60 seconds, Train B will also be able to cross the bridge without colliding with Train A.\n\nTherefore, the length of the bridge that allows both trains to cross without collision is $\\boxed{200.2}$  meters."}

First, we identify the symmetry axis of the parabola represented by $f(x)$. The formula for the axis of symmetry in a quadratic function $ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. For our function, $a = 1$ and $b = -2$, leading to:\n\\[x = -\\frac{-2}{2*1} = 1\\]\nThis means the parabola has a symmetry axis at $x = 1$, which lies within the interval $[0,3]$.\n\n2. Since a parabola is symmetrical and our function opens upwards (because the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive), $f(x)$ is monotonically decreasing on $[0,1]$ and monotonically increasing on $[1,3]$. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x)$ in the interval $[0,3]$ occurs at $x=1$, and the maximum value occurs at one of the endpoints of the interval, which in this case, is at $x=3$.\n\n3. Calculating the minimum value of $f(x)$ at $x = 1$:\n\\[f(1) = 1^2 - 2(1) + 4 = 1 - 2 + 4 = 3\\]\n\n4. Calculating the maximum value of $f(x)$ at $x = 3$:\n\\[f(3) = 3^2 - 2(3) + 4 = 9 - 6 + 4 = 7\\]\n\n5. Based on the calculations, $f_{\\min}(x) = 3$ and $f_{\\max}(x) = 7$, so the range of $f(x)$ for $x \\in [0,3]$ is $[3,7]$.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function $f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 4$ for $x \\in [0,3]$ is $\\boxed{[3,7]}$."}

The fact that we can conclude divisibility by 60 from divisibility by 3, 4, and 5 is based on the fact that no two of these numbers have a common divisor greater than 1.

How many cooks does the restaurant have?", "answer": "9", "solution": "Let's denote the number of cooks as C and the number of waiters as W. According to the problem, the initial ratio of cooks to waiters is 3:8, which can be written as:\n\nC / W = 3 / 8\n\nWhen 12 more waiters are hired, the number of waiters becomes W + 12, and the new ratio of cooks to waiters is 1:4, which can be written as:\n\nC / (W + 12) = 1 / 4\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can solve these equations to find the value of C (the number of cooks).\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express C in terms of W:\n\nC = (3 / 8) * W\n\nNow, let's substitute this expression for C into the second equation:\n\n(3 / 8) * W / (W + 12) = 1 / 4\n\nCross-multiply to get rid of the fractions:\n\n4 * (3 / 8) * W = 1 * (W + 12)\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n(3 / 2) * W = W + 12\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n3W = 2W + 24\n\nSubtract 2W from both sides:\n\nW = 24\n\nNow that we have the number of waiters, we can find the number of cooks using the initial ratio:\n\nC = (3 / 8) * W\nC = (3 / 8) * 24\nC = 3 * 3\nC = 9\n\nSo, the restaurant has $\\boxed{9}$  cooks."}

Since he has enough hats to wear a different one every day for 20 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week, he has:\n\n20 weeks * 7 days/week = 140 hats\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the hats. Since the cost varies on odd and even days, we need to find out how many odd and even days there are in 140 days.\n\nHalf of the days will be odd, and half will be even, so:\n\nOdd days: 140 / 2 = 70 days\nEven days: 140 / 2 = 70 days\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost for the odd and even days:\n\nCost of hats on odd days: 70 hats * $45/hat = $3150\nCost of hats on even days: 70 hats * $60/hat = $4200\n\nTotal cost without discount: $3150 + $4200 = $7350\n\nSince John is buying at least 50 hats, he is eligible for a 10% discount.

That means the differences $S_{2n} - S_n$ and $S_{3n} - S_{2n}$ will also form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nSince $S_{10} = 12$ and $S_{20} = 17$, the difference between these two sums is:\n$$S_{20} - S_{10} = 17 - 12 = 5.$$\n\nThis difference is a constant for an arithmetic series, so the difference between $S_{20}$ and $S_{30}$ will be the same as the difference between $S_{10}$ and $S_{20}$:\n$$S_{30} - S_{20} = 5.$$\n\nHowever, we want the sum at $n=30$, not just the difference, so we add this difference to $S_{20}$ to find $S_{30}$:\n$$S_{30} = S_{20} + (S_{30} - S_{20}) = 17 + 5 = 22.$$\n\nThis does not match any of the options provided. After checking my calculations and reasoning, the process seems correct, but the initial argument about the difference forming an arithmetic sequence only guarantees that increments between $S_n$ and $S_{2n}$ will be uniform. But, this doesn't apply directly to consecutive sums like $S_{20}$ and $S_{30}$.\n\nTherefore, we need to reassess the initial assumptions. The step claiming that the difference $S_{30} - S_{20}$ would be the same as $S_{20} - S_{10}$ was incorrect. The correct assumption for an arithmetic sequence's sum would be that the differences $S_{20} - S_{10}$ and $S_{30} - S_{20}$ are not necessarily equal, but instead, the increments increase at a constant rate.\n\nSince the increment from $S_{10}$ to $S_{20}$ is 5, the next increment (from $S_{20}$ to $S_{30}$) will likely be 5 more than the previous increment (since the common difference in the sums would increase by the sequence's common difference each time), making the next increment 0:\n$$ S_{30} - S_{20} = 5 + (5 - 5) = 5. $$\n\nThen, calculating $S_{30}$ gives:\n$$ S_{30} = S_{20} + (S_{30} - S_{20}) = 17 + 5 = \\boxed{22}. $$\n\nHowever, since 22 is not an available option and further inspection reveals a calculation error, we must revisit the solution.\n\nRealizing the mistake, the correct approach would be to determine the second common difference (which is the common difference of the original sequence) to find the increment between $S_{20}$ and $S_{30}$. Since $S_{20} - S_{10} = 5$, the common difference of the arithmetic sequence is:\n$$ d = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}. $$\n\nNow, we calculate the increment from $S_{20}$ to $S_{30}$:\n$$ S_{30} - S_{20} = 10d = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 5. $$\n\nThus, we find $S_{30}$ as:\n$$ S_{30} = S_{20} + (S_{30} - S_{20}) = 17 + 5 = \\boxed{22}. $$"}

What color is the bear's fur?\n\n## B. SILLY STUFF\n\nI long hesitated, unsure what to call this book. I tried numerous titles like \"Entertaining Logic,\" \"Logical Amusements and Games,\" but couldn't decide on a suitable one. Then I decided to look in the Great Encyclopedic Dictionary. Opening it to the entry \"Amusements,\" I read: \"See Entertainment.\" Following the advice, I learned a wealth of useful information about buffoonery, games, amusements, entertaining pastimes, pranks, diversions, jokes, jesting, and humor. I discovered that one could play a trick on someone, stage a prank, start a commotion, create a ruckus, raise a dust, and even a cloud of smoke, and that there are antics, capers, antics, and even \"silly stuff.\" Upon reaching this expression, I laughed and told my wife: \"You know, I think 'Silly Stuff' is a wonderful title for my book.\" However, as expressive as such a title might be, it could give the reader a wrong impression of the book's overall content, as many of its sections hardly fit it. Nevertheless, you will soon see that the title \"Silly Stuff\" fits this section perfectly.", "answer": "white", "solution": "14. The fur must be white, as it belongs to a polar bear inhabiting the Arctic - near the North Pole. Usually, the answer is supported by the fact that the bear in the problem's conditions must be standing at the North Pole. If you step in any direction from the North Pole, you will always be moving south. Therefore, if the bear is at the North Pole and the hunter is 100 meters south of it, then, after walking 100 meters east and turning north, the hunter will face the North Pole. This is true, but as I have already said, the given solution is not the only one. Indeed, there are infinitely many solutions. For example, the hunter could be on a parallel 100 meters long, and the bear 100 meters north of him. Walking 100 meters east, the hunter will complete a full circle around the pole and return to the starting point. This is the second solution to the problem. But the hunter could be even closer to the pole on a parallel 50 meters long. Walking 100 meters, he will circle the pole twice and return to the starting point. But this is not all. The hunter could be on a parallel 1/3 of 100 meters long. Circling the pole three times along the parallel, he will also return to the starting point. Since a similar solution can be constructed for any positive integer \\( n \\), there are infinitely many places on Earth where the scenario described in the problem could have taken place.\n\nOf course, in all these solutions, it is assumed that a bear located close enough to the North Pole must necessarily be a polar bear. However, there is another possibility, albeit a very unlikely one: some malicious individual deliberately transported a brown bear to the North Pole to \"spite\" the author of the problem."}

It tests the student's comprehension and application of the standard equation of a parabola. To solve the problem, we need to determine the coordinates of the focus of the parabola and the equation of its directrix. Then, we use the distance formula from a point to a line to calculate the distance from the focus to the directrix.\n\n**Solution**\nThe given equation of the parabola is $4y = x^2$. The standard form for a parabola is $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola, and the focus is located at $(h, k + \\frac{1}{4a})$ when the parabola opens upwards.\n\nComparing the given equation with the standard form, we have $a = \\frac{1}{4}$, $(h,k) = (0,0)$.\n\nTherefore, the focus $F$ has coordinates $(0, k + \\frac{1}{4a}) = (0, 0 + \\frac{1}{4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}}) = (0, 1).$\n\nThe directrix is the line parallel to the vertex, and its equation is $y = k - \\frac{1}{4a} = 0 - \\frac{1}{4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}} = -1.$\n\nThus, the distance from the focus to the directrix is $1 - (-1) = 1 + 1$.\n\nWe can now present the calculation more precisely as follows:\n\n1. Find the focus of the parabola:\n   Focus $F = (0, 1)$.\n\n2. Write the equation of the directrix:\n   Directrix $d: y = -1$.\n\n3. Calculate the distance from the focus to the directrix:\n   Distance $=\\left| 1 - (-1) \\right| = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nHence, option B is correct."}

On which flips should the coin land tails up to get this probability?", "answer": "0.0625", "solution": "To find the flips on which the coin should land tails up to get a probability of 0.0625, we need to consider the total number of flips (4) and the probability of getting tails on any single flip (1/2).\n\nThe probability of getting tails on a specific number of flips and not on the last 2 flips can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual flip outcome.\n\nSince the last two flips must not be tails, they must be heads. The probability of getting heads on a single flip is also 1/2.\n\nLet's denote T for tails and H for heads. We are looking for a sequence of flips that includes some tails (T) and ends with two heads (HH).\n\nThe probability of getting tails on the first flip is 1/2, and the probability of getting tails on the second flip is also 1/2. The probability of getting heads on the third and fourth flips is 1/2 for each flip.\n\nSo, if we want the coin to land tails up on some flips and not on the last 2 flips, the sequence must be TTHH.\n\nThe probability of this sequence occurring is:\n(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16\n\n1/16 is equal to 0.0625 in decimal form.\n\nTherefore, the coin should land tails up on the first two flips (TTHH) to get a probability of $\\boxed{0.0625}$ ."}

Jennifer's sister is now 80 years old. How old will Jennifer be in ten years?", "answer": "30", "solution": "Let's call Jennifer's age in ten years \"J\". According to the information given, Jordana will be three times Jennifer's age at that time. So, Jordana's age in ten years will be 3J.\n\nWe know that Jordana is currently 80 years old. In ten years, Jordana will be 80 + 10 = 90 years old.\n\nSince Jordana's age in ten years will be 3 times Jennifer's age in ten years, we can set up the following equation:\n\n3J = 90\n\nNow, we solve for J:\n\nJ = 90 / 3\nJ = 30\n\nTherefore, Jennifer will be $\\boxed{30}$  years old in ten years."}

Consider the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{k}$. By the condition, $a_{1}$ is the largest among them, $a_{k}$ is the smallest; according to the made assumption, $a_{k} \\leq 1 / 2 a_{1}$.

The molar mass of AgCl is the sum of the molar masses of silver (Ag) and chlorine (Cl). The molar mass of Ag is approximately 107.87 g/mol, and the molar mass of Cl is approximately 35.45 g/mol.

We are given the following information:\n\nF = 26 (students who play football)\nB = 17 (students who play both football and long tennis)\nTotal students = 35\nStudents who play neither = 6\n\nWe want to find L, the number of students who play long tennis.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students play only football (F_only) and not long tennis. Since 17 students play both, we subtract this number from the total number of football players to find those who play only football:\n\nF_only = F - B\nF_only = 26 - 17\nF_only = 9\n\nNow, let's find the total number of students who play at least one sport (either football or long tennis or both). Since 6 students play neither, we subtract this number from the total number of students:\n\nStudents who play at least one sport = Total students - Students who play neither\nStudents who play at least one sport = 35 - 6\nStudents who play at least one sport = 29\n\nNow, we know that the number of students who play at least one sport is the sum of those who play only football, those who play only long tennis (L_only), and those who play both:\n\nStudents who play at least one sport = F_only + L_only + B\n\nWe can now solve for L_only:\n\n29 = 9 + L_only + 17\n29 = 26 + L_only\nL_only = 29 - 26\nL_only = 3\n\nFinally, to find the total number of students who play long tennis (L), we add those who play only long tennis and those who play both:\n\nL = L_only + B\nL = 3 + 17\nL = 20\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{20}$  students play long tennis."}

If earnings are greater than expected, shareholders will receive an additional $ 0.04 per share for each additional $ 0.10 of per share earnings. If quarterly earnings are $ 1.10 per share, the dividend paid to a person who owns a certain number of shares of the company's stock will be $260. How many shares does the person own?", "answer": "500", "solution": "First, let's calculate the additional earnings per share beyond the expected $0.80. The actual earnings are $1.10 per share, so the additional earnings are:\n\n$1.10 - $0.80 = $0.30 per share\n\nNow, for each additional $0.10 of per share earnings, shareholders receive an additional $0.04 per share. Since there are $0.30 of additional earnings, we divide this by $0.10 to find out how many times the shareholders will receive the additional $0.04:\n\n$0.30 / $0.10 = 3\n\nSo, shareholders will receive an additional:\n\n3 * $0.04 = $0.12 per share\n\nThe expected dividend per share is half of the expected earnings, which is $0.80 / 2 = $0.40 per share. Adding the additional dividend from the extra earnings, the total dividend per share is:\n\n$0.40 + $0.12 = $0.52 per share\n\nThe person receives a total dividend of $260. To find out how many shares they own, we divide the total dividend by the dividend per share:\n\n$260 / $0.52 = 500 shares\n\nTherefore, the person owns $\\boxed{500}$  shares of the company's stock."}

Taking the square root, in the first case we get the inequality $4.3588989 \\cdots \\leqslant x \\cdot 10^{-k}<4.4721359 \\cdots$; and in the second case, $13.784048 \\cdots \\leqslant x \\cdot 10^{-k}<14.142135 \\cdots$.\n\nIt is not difficult to see that, due to the variation of $k$, there will be infinitely many possibilities. We examine $k=1$ and $k=2$. If $4.358 \\leqslant x \\cdot 10^{-1}<4.472$, then $x=44$; if $4.358 \\leqslant x \\cdot 10^{-2}<4.472$, then $436 \\leqslant x \\leqslant 447$. If $13.784 \\cdots \\leqslant x \\cdot 10^{-1}<14.142 \\cdots$, then $x=14$; if $13.784 \\cdots \\leqslant x \\cdot 10^{-2}<14.142 \\cdots$, then $138 \\leqslant x \\leqslant 141$. When $k=3$, we similarly examine the two possible cases, and so on. Among the $x$ values we obtain, the smallest number whose last two digits are $17, 33, 67, 83$ is $1383\\left(1383^{2}=1912689\\right)$."}

In one move, exactly one frog jumps 1 to the right, and they must still be at different points. We calculated the number of ways the frogs can make $n$ moves (for some initial arrangement of frogs). Prove that if we allowed the same frogs to jump to the left, prohibiting jumping to the right, the number of ways to make $n$ moves would be the same.", "answer": "proof", "solution": "Let's call a template a sequence of $n$ words, each of which is \"Left\" or \"Right,\" where the $k$-th word indicates the direction in which frogs can jump on the $k$-th move. We will prove a stronger statement: the number of ways to make $n$ moves from a given position without frogs jumping onto each other does not depend on the template. Note that this number is equal to the number of final positions (taking multiplicities into account).\n\nLemma 1. Changing the last direction in the template does not change the number of final positions.\n\nProof. Consider an arbitrary position before the last move. Each position can be divided into groups of frogs sitting consecutively. The number of final positions obtainable from this position is equal to the number of groups, since only one frog from each group can jump left and one can jump right. Therefore, the total number of final positions will not change.\n\nLemma 2. Replacing two adjacent opposite directions in the template does not change the set of final positions. Proof. Let the two templates differ only in moves $k$ and $k+1$. Consider an arbitrary position before the $k$-th move. Each way to make two jumps from this position with different frogs according to one template corresponds to a way for the second template: the same frogs jump in a different order. Since they jump in different directions, these are also valid jumps. In both cases, the same position is obtained.\n\nEach way to make two jumps with the same frog (back and forth) according to one template corresponds to a way to make two jumps according to the second template with a frog located at the other end of the same group of frogs. Both variants do not change the position.\n\nTherefore, for these two templates, the sets of positions after $k+1$ moves are the same, and the templates coincide from that point onward.\n\nIt remains to note that using the operations indicated in the lemmas, one can transition from any template to any other: using the operations from Lemma 2, one can arbitrarily rearrange the directions, and using the operations from Lemma 1, one can arbitrarily change the number of right directions.\n\nSend a comment"}

The sixth graders comprise 38% of the students, and there are 76 sixth graders. What percentage of the students are seventh graders?", "answer": "32\\%", "solution": "First, we need to find out the total number of students at the school. We know that the sixth graders comprise 38% of the students and there are 76 sixth graders. \n\nLet's call the total number of students at the school T. \n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n76 = 0.38 * T\n\nTo find T, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.38:\n\nT = 76 / 0.38\nT = 200\n\nSo, there are 200 students in total at the school.\n\nNow, we know there are 64 seventh graders. To find out what percentage they represent, we use the formula:\n\nPercentage = (Number of seventh graders / Total number of students) * 100\n\nPercentage = (64 / 200) * 100\nPercentage = 0.32 * 100\nPercentage = 32%\n\nTherefore, the seventh graders represent $\\boxed{32\\%}$  of the students at the school."}

In every step we choose two distinct sheets; if the numbers on the two sheets are $a$ and $b$, then we erase these numbers and write the number $a+b$ on both sheets. Prove that after $m 2^{m-1}$ steps, the sum of the numbers on all the sheets is at least $4^{m}$. (Iran)", "answer": "4^{m}", "solution": "Let $P_{k}$ be the product of the numbers on the sheets after $k$ steps. Suppose that in the $(k+1)^{\\text {th }}$ step the numbers $a$ and $b$ are replaced by $a+b$. In the product, the number $a b$ is replaced by $(a+b)^{2}$, and the other factors do not change. Since $(a+b)^{2} \\geqslant 4 a b$, we see that $P_{k+1} \\geqslant 4 P_{k}$. Starting with $P_{0}=1$, a straightforward induction yields  $$ P_{k} \\geqslant 4^{k} $$  for all integers $k \\geqslant 0$; in particular  $$ P_{m \\cdot 2^{m-1}} \\geqslant 4^{m \\cdot 2^{m-1}}=\\left(2^{m}\\right)^{2^{m}} $$  so by the AM-GM inequality, the sum of the numbers written on the sheets after $m 2^{m-1}$ steps is at least  $$ 2^{m} \\cdot \\sqrt[2^{m}]{P_{m \\cdot 2^{m-1}}} \\geqslant 2^{m} \\cdot 2^{m}=4^{m} $$  Comment 1. It is possible to achieve the sum $4^{m}$ in $m 2^{m-1}$ steps. For example, starting from $2^{m}$ equal numbers on the sheets, in $2^{m-1}$ consecutive steps we can double all numbers. After $m$ such doubling rounds we have the number $2^{m}$ on every sheet.  Comment 2. There are several versions of the solution above. E.g., one may try to assign to each positive integer $n$ a weight $w_{n}$ in such a way that the sum of the weights of the numbers written on the sheets increases, say, by at least 2 in each step. For this purpose, one needs the inequality  $$ 2 w_{a+b} \\geqslant w_{a}+w_{b}+2 $$  to be satisfied for all positive integers $a$ and $b$. Starting from $w_{1}=1$ and trying to choose the weights as small as possible, one may find that these weights can be defined as follows: For every positive integer $n$, one chooses $k$ to be the maximal integer such that $n \\geqslant 2^{k}$, and puts  $$ w_{n}=k+\\frac{n}{2^{k}}=\\min _{d \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\geq 0}\\left(d+\\frac{n}{2^{d}}\\right) . $$  Now, in order to prove that these weights satisfy (1), one may take arbitrary positive integers $a$ and $b$, and choose an integer $d \\geqslant 0$ such that $w_{a+b}=d+\\frac{a+b}{2^{d}}$. Then one has  $$ 2 w_{a+b}=2 d+2 \\cdot \\frac{a+b}{2^{d}}=\\left((d-1)+\\frac{a}{2^{d-1}}\\right)+\\left((d-1)+\\frac{b}{2^{d-1}}\\right)+2 \\geqslant w_{a}+w_{b}+2 $$  Since the initial sum of the weights was $2^{m}$, after $m 2^{m-1}$ steps the sum is at least $(m+1) 2^{m}$. To finish the solution, one may notice that by (2) for every positive integer $a$ one has  $$ w_{a} \\leqslant m+\\frac{a}{2^{m}}, \\quad \\text { i.e., } \\quad a \\geqslant 2^{m}\\left(-m+w_{a}\\right) $$  So the sum of the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{2^{m}}$ on the sheets can be estimated as  $$ \\sum_{i=1}^{2^{m}} a_{i} \\geqslant \\sum_{i=1}^{2^{m}} 2^{m}\\left(-m+w_{a_{i}}\\right)=-m 2^{m} \\cdot 2^{m}+2^{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{2^{m}} w_{a_{i}} \\geqslant-m 4^{m}+(m+1) 4^{m}=4^{m} $$  as required. For establishing the inequalities (1) and (3), one may also use the convexity argument, instead of the second definition of $w_{n}$ in (2).  One may check that $\\log _{2} n \\leqslant w_{n} \\leqslant \\log _{2} n+1$; thus, in some rough sense, this approach is obtained by \"taking the logarithm\" of the solution above.  Comment 3. An intuitive strategy to minimise the sum of numbers is that in every step we choose the two smallest numbers. We may call this the greedy strategy. In the following paragraphs we prove that the greedy strategy indeed provides the least possible sum of numbers.  Claim. Starting from any sequence $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}$ of positive real numbers on $N$ sheets, for any number $k$ of steps, the greedy strategy achieves the lowest possible sum of numbers.  Proof. We apply induction on $k$; for $k=1$ the statement is obvious. Let $k \\geqslant 2$, and assume that the claim is true for smaller values.  Every sequence of $k$ steps can be encoded as $S=\\left(\\left(i_{1}, j_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(i_{k}, j_{k}\\right)\\right)$, where, for $r=1,2, \\ldots, k$, the numbers $i_{r}$ and $j_{r}$ are the indices of the two sheets that are chosen in the $r^{\\text {th }}$ step. The resulting final sum will be some linear combination of $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}$, say, $c_{1} x_{1}+\\cdots+c_{N} x_{N}$ with positive integers $c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{N}$ that depend on $S$ only. Call the numbers $\\left(c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{N}\\right)$ the characteristic vector of $S$.  Choose a sequence $S_{0}=\\left(\\left(i_{1}, j_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(i_{k}, j_{k}\\right)\\right)$ of steps that produces the minimal sum, starting from $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}$, and let $\\left(c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{N}\\right)$ be the characteristic vector of $S$. We may assume that the sheets are indexed in such an order that $c_{1} \\geqslant c_{2} \\geqslant \\cdots \\geqslant c_{N}$. If the sheets (and the numbers) are permuted by a permutation $\\pi$ of the indices $(1,2, \\ldots, N)$ and then the same steps are performed, we can obtain the $\\operatorname{sum} \\sum_{t=1}^{N} c_{t} x_{\\pi(t)}$. By the rearrangement inequality, the smallest possible sum can be achieved when the numbers $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}\\right)$ are in non-decreasing order. So we can assume that also $x_{1} \\leqslant x_{2} \\leqslant \\cdots \\leqslant x_{N}$.  Let $\\ell$ be the largest index with $c_{1}=\\cdots=c_{\\ell}$, and let the $r^{\\text {th }}$ step be the first step for which $c_{i_{r}}=c_{1}$ or $c_{j_{r}}=c_{1}$. The role of $i_{r}$ and $j_{r}$ is symmetrical, so we can assume $c_{i_{r}}=c_{1}$ and thus $i_{r} \\leqslant \\ell$. We show that $c_{j_{r}}=c_{1}$ and $j_{r} \\leqslant \\ell$ hold, too.  Before the $r^{\\text {th }}$ step, on the $i_{r}{ }^{\\text {th }}$ sheet we had the number $x_{i_{r}}$. On the $j_{r}{ }^{\\text {th }}$ sheet there was a linear combination that contains the number $x_{j_{r}}$ with a positive integer coefficient, and possibly some other terms. In the $r^{\\text {th }}$ step, the number $x_{i_{r}}$ joins that linear combination. From this point, each sheet contains a linear combination of $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}$, with the coefficient of $x_{j_{r}}$ being not smaller than the coefficient of $x_{i_{r}}$. This is preserved to the end of the procedure, so we have $c_{j_{r}} \\geqslant c_{i_{r}}$. But $c_{i_{r}}=c_{1}$ is maximal among the coefficients, so we have $c_{j_{r}}=c_{i_{r}}=c_{1}$ and thus $j_{r} \\leqslant \\ell$.  Either from $c_{j_{r}}=c_{i_{r}}=c_{1}$ or from the arguments in the previous paragraph we can see that none of the $i_{r}{ }^{\\text {th }}$ and the $j_{r}{ }^{\\text {th }}$ sheets were used before step $r$. Therefore, the final linear combination of the numbers does not change if the step $\\left(i_{r}, j_{r}\\right)$ is performed first: the sequence of steps  $$ S_{1}=\\left(\\left(i_{r}, j_{r}\\right),\\left(i_{1}, j_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(i_{r-1}, j_{r-1}\\right),\\left(i_{r+1}, j_{r+1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(i_{N}, j_{N}\\right)\\right) $$  also produces the same minimal sum at the end.

In this case, $a_{n+2} = 1$, $a_{n+1} = 1$, and $a_n = 1$. Thus, the ratio $\\frac{a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}}{a_{n+1}-a_{n}}$ becomes $\\frac{1-1}{1-1}$, which is undefined due to division by zero. This contradicts the requirement for an arithmetic ratio sequence, where the ratio must be well-defined. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: The common ratio of an arithmetic ratio sequence must not be $0$**\n\nIf the common ratio $k = 0$, then $\\frac{a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}}{a_{n+1}-a_{n}} = 0$. This implies $a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = 0$, leading to $a_{n+2} = a_{n+1}$. However, for the ratio $\\frac{a_{n+3}-a_{n+2}}{a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}}$, the denominator becomes $0$, which is not permissible as it makes the ratio undefined. This shows that the common ratio cannot be $0$, making option B correct.\n\n**Option C: If $a_{n}=-3^{n}+2$, then the sequence $\\{a_{n}\\}$ is an arithmetic ratio sequence**\n\nFor the sequence $a_{n} = -3^n + 2$, we calculate the ratio as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}}{a_{n+1}-a_{n}} = \\frac{(-3^{n+2}+2)-(-3^{n+1}+2)}{(-3^{n+1}+2)-(-3^{n}+2)} = \\frac{-3^{n+2}+3^{n+1}}{-3^{n+1}+3^{n}} = 3\n\\]\nThis shows that the sequence has a constant ratio of $3$, thus it is an arithmetic ratio sequence. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\n**Option D: If an arithmetic sequence is an arithmetic ratio sequence, then its common ratio may be $2$**\n\nFor an arithmetic sequence, let $a_{n} = a_{1} + (n-1)d$, where $d$ is the common difference. Then, $a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = d$ and $a_{n+1} - a_{n} = d$. The ratio is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}}{a_{n+1}-a_{n}} = \\frac{d}{d} = 1\n\\]\nThis means that for any arithmetic sequence that is also an arithmetic ratio sequence, the common ratio must be $1$, not $2$.

Note that if \\( (x, y) \\) is a solution, then \\( (-x, y) \\) is also a solution due to the symmetry in \\( x \\). Therefore, we must have \\( x = 0 \\) to ensure a unique solution.\n\n6. Substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the equations:\n   \\[\n   0^2 = 2^{|0|} + |0| - y - m \\implies 0 = 1 - y - m\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 - y^2 = 0 \\implies y = \\pm 1\n   \\]\n\n7. For \\( y = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   0 = 1 - 1 - m \\implies m = 0\n   \\]\n\n8. For \\( y = -1 \\):\n   \\[\n   0 = 1 + 1 - m \\implies m = 2\n   \\]\n\n9. We need to check these values of \\( m \\) to ensure they result in only one root.\n\n10. If \\( m = 2 \\):\n    \\[\n    x^2 = 2^{|x|} + |x| + 1 - 2 \\implies x^2 = 2^{|x|} + |x| - 1\n    \\]\n    This equation has solutions \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\), so it does not have a unique solution.\n\n11. If \\( m = 0 \\):\n    \\[\n    x^2 = 2^{|x|} + |x| - 1\n    \\]\n    For \\( x = 0 \\):\n    \\[\n    0^2 = 2^0 + 0 - 1 \\implies 0 = 1 - 1 \\implies 0 = 0\n    \\]\n    For \\( x \\neq 0 \\), we need to check if there are any other solutions. Since \\( x^2 \\leq |x| \\) and \\( y \\leq 1 \\leq 2^{|x|} \\), we have:\n    \\[\n    x^2 + y \\leq 2^{|x|} + |x|\n    \\]\n    This implies \\( x^2 = |x| \\) and \\( y = 1 = 2^{|x|} \\). Therefore, the only solution is \\( (0, 1) \\).\n\n12. Thus, the only value of \\( m \\) that results in a unique solution is \\( m = 0 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{ m = 0 } \\)"}

Since there are three fluorine atoms in aluminum fluoride, we calculate the molecular weight as follows:\n\nMolecular weight of AlF3 = (1 x atomic weight of Al) + (3 x atomic weight of F)\nMolecular weight of AlF3 = (1 x 26.98 g/mol) + (3 x 19.00 g/mol)\nMolecular weight of AlF3 = 26.98 g/mol + 57.00 g/mol\nMolecular weight of AlF3 = 83.98 g/mol\n\nNow, to find the total weight of 10 moles of aluminum fluoride, we multiply the molecular weight by the number of moles:\n\nTotal weight = molecular weight of AlF3 x number of moles\nTotal weight = 83.98 g/mol x 10 moles\nTotal weight = 839.8 grams\n\nTherefore, the total weight of 10 moles of aluminum fluoride is $\\boxed{839.8}$  grams."}

Note the largest element is equal to $E_1$, and elements $E_{n^2-n+1}$ through $E_{n^2}$ will all be equal to $1$, as they are the $n$ smallest terms and there exist at least $n$ terms equal to $1$.\n\n3. **Best-Case Scenario:**\n   - Note that in a best-case scenario, each element is the sum of the two largest elements less than or equal to itself. This means that $E_1 \\le E_2 + E_3 \\implies E_1 \\le (E_3 + E_4) + (E_4 + E_5) \\ldots$. Working downwards in this manner, we will eventually reach a string of elements equal to $1$ whose sum is equal to $E_1$. The number of $1$s in this string is equal to the maximum value of $E_1$ in this best-case scenario.\n\n4. **Final String Composition:**\n   - Note that each element equal to $1$ in this final string is either equal to $E_{n^2-n+1}$ or $E_{n^2-n+2}$. The two are both achievable, as $E_{n^2-n-1} = E_{n^2-n+1} + E_{n^2-n}$ and $E_{n^2 - n} = E_{n^2-n+1} + E_{n^2-n+2}$. However, $E_{n^2-n+3} \\ldots E_{n^2}$ could only be achieved by adding the two next-smallest elements together; however, since both of these must be equal to $1$, they will not show up in the final string. This final string then consists exclusively of multiple instances of the elements $E_{n^2-n+1}$ and $E_{n^2-n+2}$.\n\n5. **Sequence Function $f(x)$:**\n   - Define $f(x)$ to be the number of sequences with first term $1$ and last term $x$ such that the $k$-th term of the sequence minus the $k-1$-th term of the sequence is equal to either $1$ or $2$ for all integers $2 \\le k \\le x$. I claim that the number of terms equal to $1$ in the final string is at most $f(n^2 - n) + f(n^2 - n + 1)$.\n\n6. **Counting Terms:**\n   - Note that the total number of instances of $E_{n^2-n}$ is equal to $f(n^2-n)$. Each instance of $E_{n^2-n}$ will produce one instance of $E_{n^2-n+1}$ and one instance of $E_{n^2-n+2}$. However, each instance of $E_{n^2-n-1}$ will also directly add a new instance of $E_{n^2-n+1}$ (as $E_{n^2-n-1}$ turns into $E_{n^2-n} + E_{n^2-n+1}$, only the $E_{n^2-n+1}$ is added to the count). Therefore, the number of terms equal to $1$ in the final string is equal to $f(n^2 - n) + f(n^2 - n + 1)$.\n\n7. **Fibonacci Sequence:**\n   - Note that $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) = 1$. In addition, $f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)$ (as the second-to-last term in any such sequence from $1$ to $k$ can be $k-2$, yielding $f(k-2)$ sequences, or $k-1$, yielding $f(k-1)$ sequences). Therefore, $f(k) = F_k$, the $k$-th Fibonacci number. The number of terms equal to $1$ in our final string, and therefore our largest term $E_1$, is therefore at most $F_{n^2 - n} + F_{n^2 - n + 1} = F_{n^2 - n + 2}$, as desired.\n\n8. **Bounding with $3^{\\binom{n}{2}}$:**\n   - Now, to prove that our largest term is at most $3^{\\binom{n}{2}}$, it remains sufficient to show that $F_{n^2 - n + 2} \\le 3^{\\binom{n}{2}}$ for all positive integers $n \\ge 1$. This is clearly true when $n = 1$ as $F_2 = 1$ and $3^{\\binom{1}{2}} = 1$, so it remains sufficient to demonstrate this for all positive integers $n \\ge 2$. Note this can be proven by proving that $F_{2k+2} \\le 3^k$ for all positive integers $k \\ge 2$ and then letting $k = \\binom{n}{2}$ for all possible values of $n$. Binet's Formula states that the $n$-th Fibonacci number is equal to $\\frac{\\phi^n - (-\\phi)^{-n}}{\\sqrt{5}}$. Letting $n = 2k + 2$ and substituting this in gives us $\\frac{\\phi^{2k+2} - (-\\phi)^{-2k-2}}{\\sqrt{5}} \\le 3^k \\implies \\phi^{2k+2} - (-\\phi)^{-2k-2} \\le \\sqrt{5} \\cdot 3^k$.\n\n9. **Simplifying the Inequality:**\n   - Note that $2k+2$ is always even, so $(-\\phi)^{-2k-2} = \\phi^{-2k-2}$. We then have $\\phi^{2k+2} + \\frac{1}{\\phi^{2k+2}} \\le \\sqrt{5} \\cdot 3^k$. Since $\\phi^{2k+2} + \\frac{1}{\\phi^{2k+2}} > \\phi^{2k+2}$, it is sufficient to show that $\\phi^{2k+2} \\le \\sqrt{5} \\cdot 3^k$ for all positive integers $k \\ge 2$.\n\n10. **Substituting $\\phi$:**\n    - We substitute in $\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$ for $\\phi$ and multiply both sides by $2^{2k+2}$, which simplifies our inequality to $(1 + \\sqrt{5})^{2k+2} \\le 2^{2k+2} \\cdot 3^k \\cdot \\sqrt{5}$. Note that $2^{2k+2} = 4^{k+1}$, so the right-hand side is equal to $4^{k+1} \\cdot 3^k \\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 12^k \\cdot 4\\sqrt{5}$.\n\n11. **Final Simplification:**\n    - Our inequality has now been simplified to $(1 + \\sqrt{5})^{2k+2} \\le 12^k \\cdot 4\\sqrt{5}$. Note that $(1 + \\sqrt{5})^{2k+2} = (6 + 2\\sqrt{5})^{k+1} = (6 + 2\\sqrt{5}) \\cdot (6 + 2\\sqrt{5})^k$, further reducing this inequality to $(6 + 2\\sqrt{5}) \\cdot (6 + 2\\sqrt{5})^k \\le 12^k \\cdot 4\\sqrt{5}$. Dividing both sides by $12^k$ gives us $(\\frac{6 + 2\\sqrt{5}}{12})^k \\le 4\\sqrt{5}$. Note that this can be directly computed and shown to be true when $k = 2$. Additionally, $0 < \\frac{6 + 2\\sqrt{5}}{12} < 1$. Higher values of $k$ will then be equivalent to repeatedly multiplying a value between $0$ and $4\\sqrt{5}$ by a value between $0$ and $1$, which will only further decrease the value of the LHS while keeping the RHS constant. Therefore, our inequality holds true for all $k \\ge 2$, thus proving that the largest element in an $n$-city can never be greater than $3^{\\binom{n}{2}}$ for all integer $n \\ge 1$.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\nThe final answer is $3^{\\binom{n}{2}}$"}

If it passes through the vertex with the number 1 or the vertex with the number 2017, it is easy to see that the symmetric numbers differ by 1, and on one side of the axis, the numbers are always larger. If the axis passes through any other vertex $k$, consider first the pair of numbers adjacent to $k$, then the pair of numbers two positions away from $k$, and so on. Initially, the numbers on one side of the axis decrease (we will call this side the smaller side), while on the other side, they increase (we will call this side the larger side). Then, when passing through 1 or 2017, the monotonicity on one of the sides changes, and now the numbers on both sides either decrease or increase simultaneously. However, they always change by 2, so the numbers on the smaller side remain smaller than the corresponding numbers on the larger side. Finally, after passing through the second number in the pair 1 or 2017, the numbers on the larger side decrease, while on the smaller side, they increase. It remains to note that in the last pair of symmetric numbers, the number on the larger side is 2 greater than the number on the smaller side."}

Since there are 8 teams, then it seems as if there are $8 \\cdot 7=56$ games, except that each game has been counted twice in this total (since, for example, we have counted $\\mathrm{G}$ playing $\\mathrm{K}$ and $\\mathrm{K}$ playing $\\mathrm{G}$ ). Thus, there are in fact $\\frac{8 \\cdot 7}{2}=28$ games played. Since there are 28 games played and there are 2 equally likely outcomes for each game, then there are $2^{28}$ possible combinations of outcomes. (We can consider that the games are numbered from 1 to 28 and that F plays $\\mathrm{G}$ in game 1, F plays $\\mathrm{H}$ in game 2, and so on. A possible combination of outcomes for the tournament can be thought of as a \"word\" with 28 letters, the first letter being $\\mathrm{F}$ or $\\mathrm{G}$ (depending on the winner of the first game), the second letter being $\\mathrm{F}$ or $\\mathrm{H}$ (depending on the winner of the second game), and so on. There are two choices for each letter in the word, and so $2^{28}$ possible words.)\n\nTo determine the probability that every team loses at least one game and every team wins at least one game, we determine the probability that there is a team that loses 0 games or a team that wins 0 games and subtract this probability from 1.\n\nSince we know the total number of possible combinations of outcomes, we determine the probability by counting the number of combinations of outcomes in which there is a team that loses 0 games (that is, wins all of its games) or a team that wins 0 games (that is, loses all of its games), or both.\n\nTo determine the number of combinations of outcomes in which there is a team that wins all of its games, we note that there are 8 ways to choose this team. Once a team is chosen (we call this team $\\mathrm{X}$ ), the results of the 7 games played by $\\mathrm{X}$ are determined ( $\\mathrm{X}$ wins all of these) and the outcomes of the remaining $28-7=21$ games are undetermined.\n\nSince there are two possible outcomes for each of these 21 undetermined games, then there are $8 \\cdot 2^{21}$ combinations of outcomes in which there is a team that wins all of its games. (Note that there cannot be two teams that win all of their games, since these two teams have to play a game.) Similarly, there are $8 \\cdot 2^{21}$ combinations of outcomes in which there is a team that loses all of its games. (Can you see why?)\n\nBefore arriving at our conclusion, we note that there might be combinations of outcomes that are included in both of these counts. That is, there might be combinations of outcomes in which there is a team that wins all of its games and in which there is a team that loses all of its games.\n\nSince this total has been included in both sets of $8 \\cdot 2^{21}$ combinations of outcomes, we need to determine this total and subtract it once to leave these combinations included exactly once in our total.\n\nTo determine the number of combinations of outcomes in this case, we choose a team (X) to win all of its games and a team $(\\mathrm{Y})$ to lose all of its games.\n\nOnce $\\mathrm{X}$ is chosen, the outcomes of its 7 games are all determined ( $\\mathrm{X}$ wins).\n\nOnce $\\mathrm{Y}$ is chosen, the outcomes of its 6 additional games are all determined ( $\\mathrm{Y}$ loses these 6 games plus the game with $\\mathrm{X}$ that has already been determined).\n\nThe outcomes of the remaining $28-7-6=15$ games are undetermined.\n\nTherefore, the number of combinations of outcomes is $8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 2^{15}$ since there are 8 ways of choosing $\\mathrm{X}$, and then 7 ways of choosing $\\mathrm{Y}$ (any team but $\\mathrm{X}$ ), and then $2^{15}$ combinations of outcomes for the undetermined games.\n\nThus, there are $8 \\cdot 2^{21}+8 \\cdot 2^{21}-8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 2^{15}$ combinations of outcomes in which either one team loses 0 games or one team wins 0 games (or both).\n\nTherefore, the probability that one team loses 0 games or one team wins 0 games is\n\n$$\n\\frac{8 \\cdot 2^{21}+8 \\cdot 2^{21}-8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{28}}=\\frac{2^{15}\\left(8 \\cdot 2^{6}+8 \\cdot 2^{6}-8 \\cdot 7\\right)}{2^{28}}=\\frac{2^{3} \\cdot 2^{6}+2^{3} \\cdot 2^{6}-2^{3} \\cdot 7}{2^{13}}=\\frac{2^{6}+2^{6}-7}{2^{10}}\n$$\n\nThis means that the probability that every team loses at least one game and wins at least one game is $1-\\frac{64+64-7}{1024}=1-\\frac{121}{1024}=\\frac{903}{1024}$.\n\nANSWER: (D)"}

In each column, there are an equal number of black cells, while in each row, the number of black cells is different. What is the maximum possible number of pairs of adjacent cells of different colors? (I. Bogdanov)", "answer": "14751", "solution": "Answer. $6 \\cdot 50^{2}-5 \\cdot 50+1=14751$ pairs.\n\nSolution. Let the side length of the table be $2 n = 100$ (so $n=50$) and number the rows from top to bottom and the columns from left to right with numbers from 1 to $2 n$.\n\nIn each row, there can be from 0 to $2 n$ black cells. Since the number of black cells in all rows is different, these numbers are all numbers from 0 to $2 n$, except one (say, except $k$). Then the total number of black cells is $(0+1+\\ldots+2 n)-k=2 n^{2}+n-k$. On the other hand, since the number of cells in all columns is the same, the total number of black cells must be divisible by $2 n$. Therefore, $k=n$, and in all columns there are $2 n^{2} / (2 n) = n$ black cells.\n\nNow let's estimate the number of pairs of adjacent cells of different colors, considering separately pairs of cells adjacent horizontally and vertically.\n\nIf there are $i \\leqslant n-1$ black cells in a row, then they can participate in no more than $2 i$ horizontal pairs. If there are $i \\geqslant n+1$ black cells in a row, the same reasoning can be applied to the white cells, of which there are $2 n-i \\leqslant n-1$. Therefore, the number of horizontal pairs of different colors is no more than $2 \\cdot(2 \\cdot 0+2 \\cdot 1+\\ldots+2 \\cdot(n-1))=2 n(n-1)$.\n\nNow let's estimate the number of vertical pairs. Consider any row with an even number from 2 to $2(n-1)$; let there be $i$ black cells in it. Then either in the row above or in the row below it, the number of black cells is not equal to $100-i$; therefore, one of the vertical pairs in which the cells of our row participate will be of the same color. Therefore, there are at least $n-1$ same-color vertical pairs. Since the total number of vertical pairs is $2 n(2 n-1)$, the number of different-color vertical pairs is no more than $2 n(2 n-1)-(n-1)$. Therefore, the total number of different-color pairs is no more than $2 n(n-1)+\\left(4 n^{2}-3 n+1\\right)=6 n^{2}-5 n+1=14751$.\n\nIt remains to provide an example in which the specified number of pairs is achieved. Draw a diagonal from the upper left corner to the lower right corner in our $2 n \\times 2 n$ table. All cells lying on or below the diagonal will be painted black if they are in even rows, and white otherwise (coloring \"by rows\"). All cells lying above the diagonal will be painted black if the sum of their row and column numbers is even, and white otherwise (checkerboard coloring). An example of such a coloring for $n=4$ is shown in Fig. 3. It is easy to verify that in each column there are exactly $n$ black cells, in the $2 i$-th row there are $n+i$ black cells, and in the $(2 i-1)$-th row there are $-n-i$ black cells. Moreover, all the estimates above are achieved.\n\nComment. Only the answer - 0 points.\n\nOnly the answer and a correct example - 2 points.\n\nOnly the proof of the exact estimate - 4 points.\n\nProof of the exact estimate only for the number of vertical or only for the number of horizontal different-color pairs - 2 points (can be combined with points for a correct example).\n\nProved that there is no row containing exactly 50 black cells - 1 point, if there are no other significant advances in the work (otherwise this point is not added)."}

This means B has covered a distance of D - 35 meters in the same time it takes A to cover the full distance D.\n\nWe also know that A beats B by 7 seconds. This means that if B were to continue running for an additional 7 seconds after A finishes, B would cover the remaining 35 meters.\n\nLet's denote A's speed as V_a and B's speed as V_b.\n\nSince A's time over the course is 33 seconds, we can calculate A's speed as:\nV_a = D / 33\n\nNow, let's calculate B's speed. Since B covers D - 35 meters in 33 seconds, B's speed is:\nV_b = (D - 35) / 33\n\nWe also know that B covers the remaining 35 meters in 7 seconds, so we can write another equation for B's speed:\nV_b = 35 / 7\n\nNow we have two expressions for V_b, so we can set them equal to each other:\n(D - 35) / 33 = 35 / 7\n\nNow, let's solve for D:\nD - 35 = 35 * 33 / 7\nD - 35 = 1155 / 7\nD - 35 = 165\nD = 165 + 35\nD = 200\n\nTherefore, the total distance of the race is $\\boxed{200}$  meters."}

The tank has a length of 10 m and a width of 10 m. What is the height of the tank if 703.125 urns are needed to fill it?", "answer": "4.496", "solution": "First, let's calculate the effective volume of water that each urn can contribute to filling the tank. Since each urn can only be filled to 80% of its capacity, the effective volume of water from each urn is:\n\n0.8 m^3 (urn volume) * 0.8 (80% full) = 0.64 m^3\n\nNow, let's calculate the total volume of water needed to fill the tank using the number of urns required:\n\n703.125 urns * 0.64 m^3/urn = 449.6 m^3\n\nThis is the volume of water that is needed to fill the tank to the desired level. Now, we can calculate the height of the tank using its length and width and the volume of water it needs to hold:\n\nVolume = Length * Width * Height\n\nWe have the volume (449.6 m^3) and the length and width (10 m each), so we can solve for the height:\n\n449.6 m^3 = 10 m * 10 m * Height\n449.6 m^3 = 100 m^2 * Height\nHeight = 449.6 m^3 / 100 m^2\nHeight = 4.496 m\n\nTherefore, the height of the tank is $\\boxed{4.496}$  meters."}

{"id": "436dd68c-6fb7-4296-95b3-a81dfe90394a", "question": "A hiker walking at a constant rate of 4 kilometers per hour is passed by a cyclist traveling in the same direction along the same path at a constant rate of 18 kilometers per hour. The cyclist stops and waits for the hiker 5 minutes after passing her while the hiker continues to walk at her constant rate. How many minutes must the cyclist wait until the hiker catches up?", "answer": "17.5", "solution": "First, let's determine how far ahead the cyclist is from the hiker after 5 minutes.\n\nSince the cyclist is traveling at 18 kilometers per hour and the hiker at 4 kilometers per hour, the relative speed between them is 18 - 4 = 14 kilometers per hour.\n\nNow, we need to convert the speed to kilometers per minute, since we are dealing with minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n14 kilometers per hour / 60 minutes per hour = 0.2333 kilometers per minute.\n\nThe cyclist travels for 5 minutes at this relative speed, so the distance between the cyclist and the hiker after 5 minutes is:\n\n0.2333 kilometers per minute * 5 minutes = 1.1665 kilometers.\n\nNow, the cyclist stops and waits, while the hiker continues to walk at a speed of 4 kilometers per hour, which is:\n\n4 kilometers per hour / 60 minutes per hour = 0.0667 kilometers per minute.\n\nTo find out how long it takes for the hiker to cover the distance of 1.1665 kilometers at her speed, we divide the distance by her speed:\n\n1.1665 kilometers / 0.0667 kilometers per minute = 17.5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the cyclist must wait for $\\boxed{17.5}$  minutes for the hiker to catch up."}
