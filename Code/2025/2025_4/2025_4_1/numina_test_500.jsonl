Show that [c 1788 ] and [c 1988 ] are multiples of 17.", "answer": "proof", "solution": "Put f(x) = x 3 - 3x 2 + 1. Let the roots be a  0, so |a|  0, so a n + b n > 0. Finally, a 2 + b 2 = (a + b) 2 - 2ab = (3 - c) 2 + 2/c = 9 - 6c + c 2 + 2/c. But c 3 - 3c + 1 = 0, so -6c + c 2 + 2/c = -c 2 . Hence a 2 + b 2 = 9 - c 2  1. Put u n = a n + b n + c n . Then u 0 = 3, u 1 = 3, u 2 = (a + b + c) 2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 9 and u n+3 = 3u n+2 - u n . Hence u n is an integer for all n. Hence [c n ] = u n - 1. Working mod 17, we have u 0 = 3, u 1 = 3, u 2 = 9. Hence u 3 = 3·9 - 3 = 7, u 4 = 3·7 - 3 = 1, u 5 = 3·1 - 9 = 11, u 6 = 3·11 - 7 = 9, u 7 = 3·9 - 1 = 9, u 8 = 3·9 - 11 = -1, u 9 = -3·1 - 9 = 5, u 10 =3·5 - 9 = 6, u 11 = 3·6 + 1 = 2, u 12 = 3·2 - 5 = 1, u 13 = 3·1 - 6 = -3, u 14 = -3·3 - 2 = 6, u 15 = 3·6 - 1 = 0, u 16 = 3·0 + 3 = 3, u 17 = 3·3 - 6 = 3, u 18 = 3·3 - 0 = 9. Hence u n = u n+16 mod 17 for n = 0, 1, 2. So the recurrence relation implies that u n = u n+16 mod 17 for all n, and hence that u n = u m mod 17 if n = m mod 16. Hence, in particular, u 1788 = u 12 = 1 mod 17, and u 1988 = u 4 = 1 mod 17. Hence [c 1788 ] and [c 1988 ] are divisible by 17. 29th IMO shortlist 1988 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 30 Dec 2002 Last corrected/updated 30 Dec 02"}

We approach this problem by considering two cases based on the sign of $x$.\n\n### Case 1: $x > 0$\n\nGiven $x+y=2$ and $y>0$, we can express $x$ as $x=2-y$. Since $y>0$, it follows that $x0$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{|x|}+\\frac{|x|}{y+2} &= \\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{x}{y+2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{x}{4-x} \\\\\n&= \\frac{4}{4x} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{4-x+x}{4x} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{4-x}{4x} + \\frac{x}{4-x} \\\\\n&\\geqslant \\frac{1}{4} + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{5}{4}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe equality holds when $x=\\frac{4}{3}$, $y=\\frac{2}{3}$. Therefore, when $x>0$, the minimum value of the given expression is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{4}}$.\n\n### Case 2: $x < 0$\n\nWhen $x<0$, we analyze the expression $\\frac{1}{|x|}+\\frac{|x|}{y+2}$ as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{|x|}+\\frac{|x|}{y+2} &= \\frac{1}{-x}+\\frac{-x}{y+2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{-x}+\\frac{-x}{4-x} \\\\\n&= \\frac{4-x+x}{-4x} + \\frac{-x}{4-x} \\\\\n&= \\frac{4-x}{-4x} + \\frac{-x}{4-x} - \\frac{1}{4} \\\\\n&\\geqslant 2\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} - \\frac{1}{4} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3}{4}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe equality is achieved when $x=-4$, $y=6$. Thus, for $x<0$, the minimum value of the given expression is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing both cases, we find that the possible values of $\\frac{1}{|x|}+\\frac{|x|}{y+2}$ are $\\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{5}{4}$.

It is a complicated trial. The number of hours spent in jury deliberation was the equivalent of 6 full days. They spend some hours a day in deliberation. John spends 19 days on jury duty. How many hours a day do they spend in deliberation?", "answer": "16", "solution": "First, let's determine the total number of days spent on the trial, excluding jury selection and deliberation. We know that jury selection takes 2 days and that the trial lasts 4 times as long as jury selection. So the trial itself lasts 4 * 2 = 8 days.\n\nNow, let's add the days of jury selection and the trial to find out how many days are accounted for before deliberation: 2 days (jury selection) + 8 days (trial) = 10 days.\n\nSince John spends 19 days on jury duty in total, we can subtract the 10 days accounted for from the 19 days to find out how many days were spent in deliberation: 19 days (total) - 10 days (jury selection + trial) = 9 days of deliberation.\n\nHowever, we know that the number of hours spent in jury deliberation was the equivalent of 6 full days. This means that the 9 days of deliberation were not full days. To find out how many hours a day they spend in deliberation, we need to calculate the total hours of deliberation and then divide by the number of days they deliberated.\n\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, 6 full days of deliberation would be 6 * 24 = 144 hours.\n\nNow, we divide the total hours of deliberation by the number of days they actually spent deliberating to find out how many hours a day they spend in deliberation: 144 hours / 9 days = 16 hours per day.\n\nTherefore, they spend $\\boxed{16}$  hours a day in deliberation."}

In how many different ways can this figure be colored?", "answer": "2", "solution": "- Given the hexagon in the first column is red, the three hexagons in the second column cannot be red and thus must be either yellow or green.\n- The three available positions in the second column can be filled by alternate coloring. Starting yellow on top, the sequence will be yellow, green, yellow or green, yellow, green.\n- Each hexagonal arrangement affects the available color choices for the adjacent hexagons. Since three hexagons in the second column affect the color choices of three hexagons in third column, and all must not be the same respective color as second column hexagons, this restricts options:\n  - If the second column is yellow, green, yellow, the third column must be green, red, green.\n  - Similarly, for green, yellow, green in the second column, the third column must be red, green, red.\n- This logic continues with the fourth column with colors being opposite to the third column.\n- Again, there are only two starting initializations for the second column. Therefore, there are two possible ways to color the fifth (fourth skipped) column, dependent on the alternates finishing in the fourth column.\n\nThe consistent alternate coloring extends through the columns, limited initially by the second column's two possible startup sequences (yellow-green-yellow or green-yellow-green), and so the entire figure can be determined by just this choice.

The equation of the median can be derived from the slope, $-3 = \\frac{s - \\frac{31}{2}}{r - \\frac{43}{2}}$. By cross multiplying and rearranging the terms, we find $-3r + \\frac{43\\cdot3}{2} = s - \\frac{31}{2}$, simplifying to $s = -3r + 98$.\n\nNext, we compute the area of triangle $XYZ$ in terms of its vertices using the determinant formula.

This leads us to two inequalities:\n- For $x \\ge 1$, subtracting $1$ from both sides: $x-1  -1$.\n\nCombining these, we get the inequality: $-1 < x < 3$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the second condition, \"$x(x-3) \\lt 0$成立\"**\n\nFor $x(x-3) < 0$, we recognize this as a quadratic inequality.

This means every $x$ that satisfies $x(x-3) < 0$ will also satisfy $|x-1| < 2$, but not every $x$ that satisfies $|x-1| < 2$ will satisfy $x(x-3) < 0$.

Then, the angular velocities of the minute hand and the second hand are $12w$ and $720w$, respectively.  \nFirst, consider the angle, denoted as $x$, at which the hour hand overlaps with the minute hand. We have the equation:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{x}{w} = \\frac{x + 360n}{12w}\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the number of times the minute hand has lapped the hour hand.

In an attempt to colonize Mars, humanity flooded the solar system with 50 satellites, which established 225 communication lines between them (each line exists between one pair of satellites, and no two satellites have more than one line between them). We say that a trio of satellites is connected if one of them has communication lines established with both of the other two satellites. Determine the smallest and largest possible number of connected trios of satellites. (The order of satellites in pairs or trios does not matter.)\n\n(Ján Mazák, Josef Tkadlec)", "answer": "6005400", "solution": "SOLUTION. We will prove in two separate parts that satellites can form at least 600 and at most 5400 connected triples. Throughout the text, $S$ will denote the set of tangent satellites, $n=50$ their number, and $m=225$ the number of communication lines.\n\na) The maximum possible number of connected triples is 5400.\n\nA triple of satellites is connected if and only if it contains two or three communication lines. It is therefore beneficial for each possible value $i \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$ to denote as $t_{i}$ the number of those triples of satellites that have exactly $i$ communication lines. We claim that these numbers satisfy the equation\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\cdot t_{i}=m \\cdot (n-2)\n$$\n\nIndeed, both sides express the total number of ordered pairs $(T, l)$, where $T$ is a triple of satellites and $l$ is a communication line between two satellites of this triple, because on the left side we count for each individual $T$ how many pairs $(T, l)$ a given $T$ appears in, while the right side (1) expresses the fact that each $l$ appears in $n-2$ pairs $(T, l)$.\n\nFrom the proven equation (1) rewritten in the form $t_{1}+2 t_{2}+3 t_{3}=m(n-2)$, we get an estimate for the number $t_{2}+t_{3}$ of all connected triples of satellites:\n\n$$\nt_{2}+t_{3}=\\frac{m(n-2)-t_{1}-t_{3}}{2} \\leqq \\frac{m(n-2)}{2}=5400\n$$\n\nthe desired equality $t_{2}+t_{3}=5400$ holds if and only if $t_{1}=t_{3}=0$.

Note that each connected triple has either one or three central satellites.\n\nDefine the degree $d_{s}$ of a satellite $s$ as the number of communication lines it has. Then $s$ is the central satellite in exactly $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}d_{s} \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{1}{2} d_{s}(d_{s}-1)$ connected triples. Since each connected triple has at most 3 central satellites, for the total number $P$ of connected triples, we have\n\n$$\nP \\geqq \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{s \\in S}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nd_{s} \\\\\n2\n\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\sum_{s \\in S} d_{s}^{2}-\\sum_{s \\in S} d_{s}\\right) \\geqq \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\sum_{s \\in S} d_{s}\\right)^{2}-\\sum_{s \\in S} d_{s}\\right),\n$$\n\nwhere the last inequality follows from the inequality between the quadratic and arithmetic mean for the $n$-tuple of numbers $\\left(d_{s} \\mid s \\in S\\right)$, which is itself a consequence of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality\n\n$$\n\\left(\\sum_{s \\in S} 1 \\cdot d_{s}\\right)^{2} \\leqq\\left(\\sum_{s \\in S} 1^{2}\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\sum_{s \\in S} d_{s}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe sum $\\sum_{s \\in S} d_{s}$, which appears in the derived estimate, is equal to twice the number $m$ of all communication lines, because each line is counted exactly twice in it (once for each of its ends). By substituting the value $2 m=450$ for $\\sum_{s \\in S} d_{s}$ along with the value $n=50$ into the derived inequality, we get the promised estimate\n\n$$\nP \\geqq \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{1}{50} \\cdot 450^{2}-450\\right)=600 \\text {. }\n$$\n\nFurthermore, from our procedure, it follows that the equality $P=600$ holds if and only if all $P$ connected triples have three central satellites each and all $n=50$ satellites have the same degree, which is therefore known to be $2 m / n=9$. This can be achieved if the satellites are connected as shown in the right image (all 50 satellites are divided into five communicationally isolated groups of ten mutually connected satellites, each having the same degree of 9).\n\n## NOTES."}

Find the range of values for the area of $\\triangle PMN$.", "answer": "[\\sqrt{6}-2, +\\infty)", "solution": "### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Part 1: Finding the Equation of $C_1$\n\nGiven the eccentricity of the ellipse $C_1$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, and the distance from point $F_{1}$ to the line $AF_{2}$ is $\\sqrt{2}$, we proceed as follows:\n\n1. The equation of the line $AF_{2}$ can be written as $\\frac{x}{c} + \\frac{y}{b} = 1$, which simplifies to $bx + cy - bc = 0$.\n2. The distance $d$ from $F_{1}$ to the line $AF_{2}$ is given by $d = \\frac{2bc}{\\sqrt{b^2 + c^2}} = \\sqrt{2}$.\n   - Simplifying, we get $2b^{2}c^{2} = b^{2} + c^{2}$, which we denote as equation (1).\n3. Given the eccentricity, we have $e = \\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, implying $a = \\sqrt{2}c$, which we denote as equation (2).\n4. Also, we know that $a^{2} = b^{2} + c^{2}$, which we denote as equation (3).\n5. Solving equations (1), (2), and (3) together, we find $a^{2} = 2$ and $b^{2} = 1$.\n   - Therefore, the equation of $C_{1}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1}$.\n\n#### Part 2: Finding the Range of Values for the Area of $\\triangle PMN$\n\n1. Let the equation of line $l$ be $x = ty + \\sqrt{3}$. Given the slope of the asymptote of $C_{2}$ is $1$, we have $-1 < t < 1$.\n2. Solving the system $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{x = ty + \\sqrt{3}}\\\\{x^{2} - y^{2} = 1}\\end{array}\\right.$, we obtain $({t^2}-1)y^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}ty + 2 = 0$.\n3. Let $M(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $N(x_{2}, y_{2})$. We find ${y_1} + {y_2} = -\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}t}{{t^2}-1}$ and ${y_1}{y_2} = \\frac{2}{{t^2}-1}$.\n4. The length $|MN|$ is calculated as $|MN| = \\sqrt{1+{t^2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{({{y_1}+{y_2}})^2 - 4{y_1}{y_2}} = 2\\sqrt{1+{t^2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2+{t^2}}}{1-{t^2}}$.\n5. For the line parallel to $l$ and tangent to the ellipse $\\frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1$, denoted as $l_{1}$: $x = ty + m (-1 < t < 1)$, we solve $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{x = ty + m}\\\\{x^{2} + 2y^{2} = 2}\\end{array}\\right.$ to get $(t^{2}+2)y^{2} + 2mty + m^{2} - 2 = 0$.\n   - From $\\Delta = 4m^{2}t^{2} - 4(t^{2}+2)(m^{2}-2) = 0$, we find $m = \\pm\\sqrt{{t^2}+2}$.\n6. The distances between line $l$ and $l_{1}$ are ${d_1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{{t^2}+2}}{\\sqrt{1+{t^2}}}$ and ${d_2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{{t^2}+2}}{\\sqrt{1+{t^2}}}$.\n7. The minimum and maximum values of the area of $\\triangle PMN$ are ${S_1} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{{t^2}+2})\\sqrt{{t^2}+2}}{1-{t^2}}$ and ${S_2} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{{t^2}+2})\\sqrt{{t^2}+2}}{1-{t^2}}$ respectively.\n8. Let $q = \\sqrt{{t^2}+2}$, where $\\sqrt{2} \\leq q < \\sqrt{3}$ and $t^{2} = q^{2}-2$.\n   - Then, ${S_1} = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}+q}$ and ${S_2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}-q}-1$, with $\\sqrt{2} \\leq q < \\sqrt{3}$.\n9. Therefore, $\\sqrt{6}-2 \\leq {S_1} < \\frac{1}{2}$ and ${S_2} \\geq \\sqrt{6}+2$.\n   - Hence, the range of values for the area of $\\triangle PMN$ is $\\boxed{[\\sqrt{6}-2, +\\infty)}$."}

First, we construct an example with $n^{2}+n+1 n$-tuples, each two of them forming an exquisite pair. In the following list, $*$ represents any number of zeros as long as the total number of entries is $n$.\n- $(*)$\n- $(*, 1, *)$\n- $(*,-1, *)$\n- $(*, 1, *, 1, *)$\n- $(*, 1, *,-1, *)$\nFor example, for $n=2$ we have the tuples $(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0),(1,1),(1,-1)$.\nThe total number of such tuples is $1+n+n+\\binom{n}{2}+\\binom{n}{2}=n^{2}+n+1$. For any two of them, at most two of the products $a_{i} b_{i}$ are non-zero. The only case in which two of them are non-zero is when we take a sequence $(*, 1, *, 1, *)$ and a sequence $(*, 1, *,-1, *)$ with zero entries in the same places. But in this case one $a_{i} b_{i}$ is 1 and the other -1 . This shows that any two of these sequences form an exquisite pair.\n\nNext, we claim that among any $n^{2}+n+2$ tuples, some two of them do not form an exquisite pair. We begin with lemma.\n\nLemma. Given $2 n+1$ distinct non-zero $n$-tuples of real numbers, some two of them $\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$ and $\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right)$ satisfy $a_{1} b_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}>0$.\n\nProof of Lemma. We proceed by induction. The statement is easy for $n=1$ since for every three non-zero numbers there are two of them with the same sign. Assume that the statement is true for $n-1$ and consider $2 n+1$ tuples with $n$ entries. Since we are working with tuples of real numbers, we claim that we may assume that one of the tuples is $a=(0,0, \\ldots, 0,-1)$. Let us postpone the proof of this claim for the moment.\n\nIf one of the remaining tuples $b$ has a negative last entry, then $a$ and $b$ satisfy the desired condition. So we may assume all the remaining tuples has a non-negative last entry. Now, from each tuple remove the last number. If two $n$-tuples $b$ and $c$ yield the same $(n-1)$-tuple, then\n$$\nb_{1} c_{1}+\\cdots+b_{n-1} c_{n-1}+b_{n} c_{n}=b_{1}^{2}+\\cdots+b_{n-1}^{2}+b_{n} c_{n}>0 \\text {, }\n$$\nand we are done. The remaining case is that all the $n$-tuples yield distinct $(n-1)$-tuples. Then at most one of them is the zero $(n-1)$-tuple, and thus we can use the inductive hypothesis on $2 n-1$ of them. So we find $b$ and $c$ for which\n$$\n\\left(b_{1} c_{1}+\\cdots+b_{n-1} c_{n-1}\\right)+b_{n} c_{n}>0+b_{n} c_{n}>0 .\n$$\n\nThe only thing that we are left to prove is that in the inductive step we may assume that one of the tuples is $a=(0,0, \\ldots, 0,-1)$. Fix one of the tuples $x=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$. Set a real number $\\varphi$ for which $\\tan \\varphi=\\frac{x_{1}}{x_{2}}$. Change each tuple $a=\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$ (including $x$ ), to the tuple\n$$\n\\left(a_{1} \\cos \\varphi-a_{2} \\sin \\varphi, a_{1} \\sin \\varphi+a_{2} \\cos \\varphi, a_{3}, a_{4}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right) .\n$$\n\nA straightforward calculation shows that the first coordinate of the tuple $x$ becomes 0 , and that all the expressions of the form $a_{1} b_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}$ are preserved. We may iterate this process until all the entries of $x$ except for the last one are equal to 0 . We finish by multiplying all the entries in all the tuples by a suitable constant that makes the last entry of $x$ equal to -1 . This preserves the sign of all the expressions of the form $a_{1} b_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}$.\n\nWe proceed to the proof of our claim. Let $A$ be a set of non-zero tuples among which any two form an exquisite pair. It suffices to prove that $|A| \\leq n^{2}+n$. We can write $A$ as a disjoint union of subsets $A_{1} \\cup A_{2} \\cup \\ldots \\cup A_{n}$, where $A_{i}$ is the set of tuples in $A$ whose last non-zero entry appears in the $i$ th position. We will show that $\\left|A_{i}\\right| \\leq 2 i$, which will finish our proof since $2+4+\\cdots+2 n=n^{2}+n$.\n\nProceeding by contradiction, suppose that $\\left|A_{i}\\right| \\geq 2 i+1$. If $A_{i}$ has three or more tuples whose only non-zero entry is in the $i$ th position, then for two of them this entry has the same sign. Since the tuples are different and their entries are integers, this yields two tuples for which $\\left|\\sum a_{i} b_{i}\\right| \\geq 2$, a contradiction. So there are at most two such tuples. We remove them from $A_{i}$.\n\nNow, for each of the remaining tuples $a$, if it has a positive $i$ th coordinate, we keep $a$ as it is. If it has a negative $i$ th coordinate, we replace it with the opposite tuple $-a$ with entries with opposite signs. This does not changes the exquisite pairs condition.\n\nAfter making the necessary changes, we have two cases. The first case is that there are two tuples $a$ and $b$ that have the same first $i-1$ coordinates and thus\n$$\na_{1} b_{1}+\\cdots+a_{i-1} b_{i-1}=a_{1}^{2}+\\cdots+a_{i-1}^{2}>0,\n$$\nand thus is at least 1 (the entries are integers). The second case is that no two tuples have the same first $i-1$ coordinates, but then by the Lemma we find two tuples $a$ and $b$ for which\n$$\na_{1} b_{1}+\\cdots+a_{i-1} b_{i-1} \\geq 1 \\text {. }\n$$\n\nIn any case, we obtain\n$$\na_{1} b_{1}+\\cdots+a_{i-1} b_{i-1}+a_{i} b_{i} \\geq 2 .\n$$\n\nThis yields a final contradiction to the exquisite pair hypothesis."}

If we draw this plane through points $A$ and then $B$, it forms a right triangle with one leg equal to the first coordinate of $A$, and respectively $B$, and the right angle vertex at $A^{\\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime}$. (These right triangles are shown in the drawing as $A^{\\prime} K M$ and $B^{\\prime} H N$ rotated.) If we draw circles with radii $A^{\\prime} M$ around $A^{\\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime} N$ around $B^{\\prime}$, the common tangents of these circles will be the first traces of the desired planes. However, since these must also pass through the first trace point $S_{1}$ of the line $A B$, there are only two solutions to the problem. (Only one such plane is shown in the drawing.) The second trace point of the line $A B$ on $S_{2}$ is now sufficient to determine the second trace of the plane.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_4dc9087f1ca570ac0d40g-1.jpg?height=776&width=675&top_left_y=501&top_left_x=714)\n\nWe erect a third picture plane perpendicular to this plane, with the new axis ${ }_{1} t_{3}$. We determine the third images of points $A$ and $B$, which lie on the third trace $s_{3}$ of the plane. The fourth picture plane is parallel to the $s_{1} s_{2}$ plane, so ${ }_{3} t_{4}$ is parallel to $s_{3}$. On this new picture plane, the distance between points $A$ and $B$, as well as the circle to be constructed, will be visible in their full size and shape. The fourth images of points $A$ and $B$ can be easily obtained. To construct the fourth image of the circle, note that the circle will touch the first picture plane. Therefore, the point of tangency lies on the first trace of the plane, meaning the third image of this point $C^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}$ is on the ${ }_{1} t_{3}$ axis; hence, its fourth image $C^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}$ lies on a line perpendicular to ${ }_{3} t_{4}$. The fourth image of the circle should be drawn to touch this $C^{\\prime \\prime \\prime} C^{I V}$ line and pass through points $A^{I V} B^{I V}$. The third, first, and second images of the circle can be completed from the fourth image.\n\nThe cone to be constructed will appear as a cross-section in the third image, which we will draw and use to construct the first and second images of the cone.\n\n(Reichert Pál, Gyór.)\n\nSecond solution. The plane of the circle touches the cone whose vertex is, for example, the $S_{2}$ point of the line $A B$ and whose generators form a $60^{\\circ}$ angle with the first picture plane. Thus, the plane can be constructed through the line $A B$ and then rotated into the first picture plane; here, the circle is drawn using the 2nd Apollonius problem, considering that the circle touches the first trace of the plane. After restoring the plane, the first and second projections of the circle can be constructed.\n\nSince the plane of the circle forms a $60^{\\circ}$ angle with the first picture plane and the generators of the cone to be constructed, the highest generator of this cone is parallel to the first picture plane. Therefore, the second image of this generator is parallel to the ${ }_{1} t_{2}$ axis; but touching the second image of the circle, it coincides with the tangent at the highest point $D^{\\prime \\prime}$ of this ellipse. If we draw the second projection of the cone's axis through point $O^{\\prime \\prime}$ perpendicular to $s_{2}$, we get the second projection of the cone's vertex $G^{\\prime \\prime}$ and from there, by projection, its first projection.\n\n(Heimlich Pál and Ruvald Sándor, Budapest.)\n\nThe problem was also solved by: Dömény I., Földes R., Haar A., Kaczander E., Messer P., Pichler S., Schuster Gy., Sonnenfeld J., Stróbl J., Tandlich E."}

After the deck is empty, each player checks if he can throw out one of his cards so that each of the ten digits occurs on an even number of his remaining cards. If one player can do this but the other one cannot, the one who can is the winner; otherwise a draw is declared. Determine all possible first moves of the first player after which he has a winning strategy. (Russia)", "answer": "proof", "solution": "Let us identify each card with the set of digits written on it. For any collection of cards $C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{k}$ denote by their sum the set $C_{1} \\triangle C_{2} \\triangle \\cdots \\triangle C_{k}$ consisting of all elements belonging to an odd number of the $C_{i}$'s. Denote the first and the second player by $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{S}$, respectively. Since each digit is written on exactly 512 cards, the sum of all the cards is $\\varnothing$. Therefore, at the end of the game the sum of all the cards of $\\mathcal{F}$ will be the same as that of $\\mathcal{S}$; denote this sum by $C$. Then the player who took $C$ can throw it out and get the desired situation, while the other one cannot. Thus, the player getting card $C$ wins, and no draw is possible. Now, given a nonempty card $B$, one can easily see that all the cards can be split into 512 pairs of the form $(X, X \\triangle B)$ because $(X \\triangle B) \\triangle B=X$. The following lemma shows a property of such a partition that is important for the solution.\n\n**Lemma.** Let $B \\neq \\varnothing$ be some card. Let us choose 512 cards so that exactly one card is chosen from every pair $(X, X \\triangle B)$. Then the sum of all chosen cards is either $\\varnothing$ or $B$.\n\n**Proof.** Let $b$ be some element of $B$. Enumerate the pairs; let $X_{i}$ be the card not containing $b$ in the $i^{\\text{th}}$ pair, and let $Y_{i}$ be the other card in this pair. Then the sets $X_{i}$ are exactly all the sets not containing $b$, therefore each digit $a \\neq b$ is written on exactly 256 of these cards, so $X_{1} \\triangle X_{2} \\triangle \\cdots \\triangle X_{512}=\\varnothing$. Now, if we replace some summands in this sum by the other elements from their pairs, we will simply add $B$ several times to this sum, thus the sum will either remain unchanged or change by $B$, as required.\n\nNow we consider two cases.\n\n**Case 1.** Assume that $\\mathcal{F}$ takes the card $\\varnothing$ on his first move. In this case, we present a winning strategy for $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{S}$ take an arbitrary card $A$. Assume that $\\mathcal{F}$ takes card $B$ after that; then $\\mathcal{S}$ takes $A \\triangle B$. Split all 1024 cards into 512 pairs of the form $(X, X \\triangle B)$; we call two cards in one pair partners. Then the four cards taken so far form two pairs $(\\varnothing, B)$ and $(A, A \\triangle B)$ belonging to $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{S}$, respectively. On each of the subsequent moves, when $\\mathcal{F}$ takes some card, $\\mathcal{S}$ should take the partner of this card in response.\n\nConsider the situation at the end of the game. Let us for a moment replace card $A$ belonging to $\\mathcal{S}$ by $\\varnothing$. Then he would have one card from each pair; by our lemma, the sum of all these cards would be either $\\varnothing$ or $B$. Now, replacing $\\varnothing$ back by $A$ we get that the actual sum of the cards of $\\mathcal{S}$ is either $A$ or $A \\triangle B$, and he has both these cards. Thus $\\mathcal{S}$ wins.\n\n**Case 2.** Now assume that $\\mathcal{F}$ takes some card $A \\neq \\varnothing$ on his first move. Let us present a winning strategy for $\\mathcal{F}$ in this case.\n\nAssume that $\\mathcal{S}$ takes some card $B \\neq \\varnothing$ on his first move; then $\\mathcal{F}$ takes $A \\triangle B$. Again, let us split all the cards into pairs of the form $(X, X \\triangle B)$; then the cards which have not been taken yet form several complete pairs and one extra element (card $\\varnothing$ has not been taken while its partner $B$ has). Now, on each of the subsequent moves, if $\\mathcal{S}$ takes some element from a complete pair, then $\\mathcal{F}$ takes its partner. If $\\mathcal{S}$ takes the extra element, then $\\mathcal{F}$ takes an arbitrary card $Y$, and the partner of $Y$ becomes the new extra element.\n\nThus, on his last move $\\mathcal{S}$ is forced to take the extra element. After that player $\\mathcal{F}$ has cards $A$ and $A \\triangle B$, player $\\mathcal{S}$ has cards $B$ and $\\varnothing$, and $\\mathcal{F}$ has exactly one element from every other pair. Thus the situation is the same as in the previous case with roles reversed, and $\\mathcal{F}$ wins.\n\nFinally, if $\\mathcal{S}$ takes $\\varnothing$ on his first move then $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes any card which has not been taken yet by $B$ and takes $A \\triangle B$. After that, the same strategy as above is applicable.\n\n**Comment 1.** If one wants to avoid the unusual question about the first move, one may change the formulation as follows. (The difficulty of the problem would decrease somewhat.)\n\nA card deck consists of 1023 cards; on each card, a nonempty set of distinct decimal digits is written in such a way that no two of these sets coincide. Two players alternately take cards from the deck, one card per turn. When the deck is empty, each player checks if he can throw out one of his cards so that for each of the ten digits, he still holds an even number of cards with this digit. If one player can do this but the other one cannot, the one who can is the winner; otherwise a draw is declared.\n\nDetermine which of the players (if any) has a winning strategy. The winner in this version is the first player. The analysis of the game from the first two paragraphs of the previous solution applies to this version as well, except for the case $C=\\varnothing$ in which the result is a draw. Then the strategy for $\\mathcal{S}$ in Case 1 works for $\\mathcal{F}$ in this version: the sum of all his cards at the end is either $A$ or $A \\triangle B$, thus nonempty in both cases.\n\n**Comment 2.** Notice that all the cards form a vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_{2}$, with $\\triangle$ the operation of addition. Due to the automorphisms of this space, all possibilities for $\\mathcal{F}$'s first move except $\\varnothing$ are equivalent. The same holds for the response by $\\mathcal{S}$ if $\\mathcal{F}$ takes the card $\\varnothing$ on his first move.\n\n**Comment 3.** It is not that hard to show that in the initial game, $\\mathcal{F}$ has a winning move, by the idea of \"strategy stealing\".\n\nNamely, assume that $\\mathcal{S}$ has a winning strategy. Let us take two card decks and start two games, in which $\\mathcal{S}$ will act by his strategy. In the first game, $\\mathcal{F}$ takes an arbitrary card $A_{1}$; assume that $\\mathcal{S}$ takes some $B_{1}$ in response. Then $\\mathcal{F}$ takes the card $B_{1}$ at the second game; let the response by $\\mathcal{S}$ be $A_{2}$. Then $\\mathcal{F}$ takes $A_{2}$ in the first game and gets a response $B_{2}$, and so on.\n\nThis process stops at some moment when in the second game $\\mathcal{S}$ takes $A_{i}=A_{1}$. At this moment the players hold the same sets of cards in both games, but with roles reversed. Now, if some cards remain in the decks, $\\mathcal{F}$ takes an arbitrary card from the first deck starting a similar cycle.\n\nAt the end of the game, player $\\mathcal{F}$'s cards in the first game are exactly player $\\mathcal{S}$'s cards in the second game, and vice versa. Thus in one of the games $\\mathcal{F}$ will win, which is impossible by our assumption.\n\nOne may notice that the strategy in Case 2 is constructed exactly in this way from the strategy in Case 1. This is possible since every response by $\\mathcal{S}$ wins if $\\mathcal{F}$ takes the card $\\varnothing$ on his first move."}

Remove two stones from cell $n$ and place one stone each in cells $n+1, n-2$.\n\nProve that for any sequence of actions, we will reach a situation where the specified actions can no longer be performed, and this final situation does not depend on the sequence of actions (but only on the initial distribution of stones in the cells).", "answer": "proof", "solution": "Let $a_{i}$ denote the number of stones in the cell numbered $i$.\n\nThen the sequence $A=\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ defines a configuration - the arrangement of stones in the cells.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be the root of the equation $x^{2}=x+1$, which is greater than 1.\n\nWe will call the weight of the configuration $A$ the number $w(A)=\\sum a_{i} \\alpha^{i}$.\n\nWe will show that the allowed actions do not change the weight. Indeed, $\\alpha^{n+1}-\\alpha^{n}-\\alpha^{n-1}=\\alpha^{n-1}\\left(\\alpha^{2}-\\alpha-1\\right)=0$, $\\alpha^{n+1}-2 \\alpha^{n}+\\alpha^{n-2}=\\alpha^{n-2}(\\alpha-1)\\left(\\alpha^{2}-\\alpha-1\\right)=0$.\n\nWe will prove by induction on $k-$ the number of stones, that any sequence of actions terminates. For $k=1$ this is true. Suppose the statement is true for the number of stones less than $k$.\n\nConsider the process starting with the configuration $A=\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ with $\\sum a_{i}=k$. The largest number of a non-empty cell does not decrease under allowed actions, but it cannot grow indefinitely - it cannot exceed the number $n$ for which $\\alpha^{n}>w(A)$. Therefore, from some point on, the largest number of a non-empty cell stops changing, and nothing more happens to the stones that have fallen into this cell. Remove these stones, and apply the induction hypothesis to the remaining ones.\n\nIn the final configuration, there is no more than one stone in each cell, and there are no two consecutive non-empty cells. We will prove that any two configurations $A=\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ and $B=\\left(b_{i}\\right)$ with these properties have different weights. Let $n-$ be the largest number for which $a_{i}=b_{i}$; let, for definiteness, $a_{n}=1, b_{n}=0$. Remove from $A$ and $B$ all stones with numbers greater than $n$ (they coincide in $A$ and $B$). For the remaining configurations $A^{\\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime}$ we have:\n\n$$\nw\\left(A^{\\prime}\\right) \\geq \\alpha^{n}\n$$\n\n$w\\left(B^{\\prime}\\right)<\\alpha^{n-1}+\\alpha^{n-3}+\\alpha^{n-5}+\\cdots=\\alpha^{n-1} \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha^{-2}}=\\alpha^{n}$.\n\nThus, for any configuration, there is only one final configuration with the same weight; the process can only lead to it."}

If we also set $k=0$, the line equation becomes $y=2$, which clearly does not intersect with $y=0$. This indicates that $a=0$ does not satisfy the condition of the problem since the lines do not intersect.\n\n**Case 2: $a=1$**\n\nSetting $a=1$ gives us the quadratic function $y=x^{2}-2x-3$. Equating this to the line equation $y=kx-2k+2$, we get:\n\\[x^{2}-2x-3 = kx-2k+2\\]\nRearranging, we obtain:\n\\[x^{2}-(k+2)x+(2k-5) = 0\\]\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ of this quadratic equation is:\n\\[\\Delta = (k+2)^{2}-4(2k-5) = k^{2}+4k+4-8k+20 = k^{2}-4k+24\\]\n\\[= (k-2)^{2}+20\\]\nSince $(k-2)^{2} \\geq 0$ for any $k$, we have $\\Delta > 0$, indicating that the line and the parabola intersect for any value of $k$. Therefore, $a=1$ satisfies the condition.\n\n**Case 3: $a=-1$**\n\nFor $a=-1$, the quadratic function becomes $y=-x^{2}+2x+3$. Setting this equal to the line equation $y=kx-2k+2$, we get:\n\\[-x^{2}+2x+3 = kx-2k+2\\]\nRearranging, we find:\n\\[x^{2}+(k-2)x-1 = 0\\]\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ for this equation is:\n\\[\\Delta = (k-2)^{2}+4 > 0\\]\nThis positive discriminant indicates that the line and the parabola intersect for any value of $k$, meaning $a=-1$ also satisfies the condition.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince both $a=1$ and $a=-1$ satisfy the condition of the problem, we can conclude that the range of $a$ includes values greater than $0$ and also $-1$. This eliminates options $A$ (which only includes $a > 0$) and $B$ and $D$ (which do not correctly capture the range of $a$). Therefore, the correct answer, which includes both $a > 0$ and $a \\leq -\\frac{2}{3}$ (implicitly including $-1$), is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{C: a \\leq -\\frac{2}{3} \\text{ or } a > 0}\\]"}

Prove that if the circumcenters of these 6 smaller triangles are all distinct, then they are concyclic if and only if $G$ is the centroid of $\\triangle A B C$.", "answer": "proof", "solution": "Let's assume the three medians of $\\triangle ABC$ are $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$, and $G$ is the centroid. Denote the circumcenters of $\\triangle AFG$, $\\triangle BFG$, $\\triangle BGD$, $\\triangle GDC$, $\\triangle CGE$, and $\\triangle AGE$ as $O_1$, $O_2$, $O_3$, $O_4$, $O_5$, and $O_6$ respectively.\n\nBy symmetry, $O_1, O_2, O_3, O_4, O_5, O_6$ are concyclic $\\Leftrightarrow O_1, O_2, O_3, O_4$ are concyclic and $O_2, O_3, O_4, O_5$ are concyclic.\n\nFirst, we prove the sufficient condition (which is relatively more difficult), and start by proving that $O_1, O_2, O_3, O_4$ are concyclic. As shown in Figure a, let $O_1O_2$ and $O_3O_4$ intersect at $O$. Then $O$ is the circumcenter of $\\triangle FGD$.\n\nIt is easy to see that the projections of $O_1$ and $O$ on $AD$ are the midpoints of $AG$ and $GD$ respectively. Therefore, if we set $\\angle AGF = \\theta$, then $OO_1 \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{2} AD$, and similarly, $OO_4 \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{2} CF$. Hence,\n$$\n\\frac{OO_1}{OO_4} = \\frac{AD}{CF}.\n$$\n\nSince $O_2O_3 \\perp BE$, to prove that $O_1, O_2, O_3, O_4$ are concyclic, we only need to prove that $\\angle O_2O_3O = \\angle O_4O_1O$, and $\\angle O_2O_3O = \\angle BGD$.\nNow, construct $DK \\parallel GF$, with $K$ on $BG$. Then by (1), we have $\\frac{KD}{GD} = \\frac{FG}{GD} = \\frac{CF}{AD} = \\frac{OO_4}{OO_1}$, and\nFigure a $\\angle KDG = 180^\\circ - \\angle FGD - \\angle O_1OO_4$, so $\\triangle KDG \\sim \\triangle O_4OO_1$. Therefore, $\\angle BGD = \\angle O_1O_4O$, and the conclusion holds. Proof completed.\n\nNote that here we only used $FD \\parallel AC$. Similarly, $FE \\parallel BC$ is required to satisfy the other set of four points being concyclic, and this can be reversed, thus the necessity is also proven.\n\nNext, we prove that when $G$ is the centroid, $O_2, O_3, O_4, O_5$ are concyclic, using the condition $EF \\parallel BC$, which is the following proposition:\n\nIn trapezoid $EFBC$, $EF \\parallel BC$, $BE$ and $CF$ intersect at $G$, and $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$. Then the circumcenters $O_2, O_3, O_4, O_5$ of $\\triangle FBG$, $\\triangle BGD$, $\\triangle CGD$, and $\\triangle CGE$ lie on a circle. As shown in Figure b.\n\nAssume $\\angle GDB \\geq 90^\\circ \\geq \\angle GDC$. The circumcenters are positioned as shown in the figure. The problem then becomes proving $\\angle O_2O_5O = \\angle BGD$, where $O$ is the intersection of lines $O_2O_3$ and $O_4O_5$, and is also the circumcenter of $\\triangle BGC$.\nFigure b\nExactly the same as before. Since $\\angle O = 180^\\circ - \\angle BGC$, the remaining task is to prove $\\frac{O_2O}{O_5O} = \\frac{CG}{BG}$. This is obvious, because $O_5O \\sin O = \\frac{1}{2} BE$, and $O_2O \\sin O = \\frac{1}{2} CF$. Hence, $\\frac{O_2O}{O_5O} = \\frac{CF}{BE} = \\frac{CG}{BG}$. Proof completed."}

Solution: Estimation. To prove that there are no fewer than 10 huge numbers, it is sufficient to prove that among any 30 consecutive numbers, there will be a huge one. Indeed, suppose this is not the case. Then consider the largest of these 30 numbers. On one side of it, all 15 nearest numbers will be part of this set of thirty, and therefore will be less than it. But then, according to the condition, the 15 nearest numbers on the other side of it will also be less than it, meaning it will be huge. Contradiction. Example. All numbers ending in 0 can be arranged in the following order: 300, 280, 260, 240, ..., 20, 290, 270, 250, ..., 10. After them, in a similar order, we can arrange the numbers ending in 1: 291, 271, ..., 11, 281, ..., 1, and then similarly arrange the numbers ending in 2, and so on until the cycle is complete. It is not difficult to verify that all conditions will be met, and the huge numbers will be only those from 291 to 300."}

For example, if $X$ is a random variable on $\\mathcal{G}(n, p)$ that counts the number of subgraphs of $G$ in some fixed set of graphs $\\mathcal{H}$, by the definition of $E(X)$, we count the number of pairs $(G, H)$ such that $H \\in \\mathcal{H}$ and $H \\subseteq G$, with each term weighted by the probability of $\\{G\\}$.

Choosing $AB$ as such a side, let the intersection point be $M$. Let $E$ be the point that divides the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ into a ratio of 1:2 closer to $AB$. The triangle $ABE$ is isosceles, and its legs are of length $c$. The line passing through $M$ does not intersect any leg of $ABE$, but another line intersects both legs, since the division $f$ results in polygons with a diameter smaller than $c$. This other line intersects $BC$ at $N$ and $DA$ at $L$ (Figure 2). The midline of the trapezoid $LABN$ is smaller than $\\frac{a}{3}$, so one of its bases, $BN$, is also smaller. Therefore, $NC$ is larger than $\\frac{2a}{3}$ and $ND$ is longer than $2c$. The perpendicular bisector of $ND$ that lies within the square is of the same length as $ND$ and is divided by another line. The intersection point of this line is denoted by $Z$. The (possibly degenerate) triangle $NDZ$ has a base of $2c$ and legs longer than $c$. This triangle does not intersect the side $NL$, and the other two lines, according to our indirect assumption about the division $f$, divide $ND$, but the line passing through $Z$ does not intersect the legs; furthermore, one of the legs, let it be $NZ$, is not divided by the other line (since this other line can only intersect one leg outside $ND$). This means that the division $f$ does not exist, as $NZ > c$ contradicts the assumption about $f$.\n\nFinally, since $c=\\frac{a \\sqrt{13}}{6} \\geq \\sqrt{13}$, it follows that $a \\geq 6$, so the side of the square is at least 6."}

This is because in a right-angled triangle inscribed in a circle, the hypotenuse is the diameter of the circle, and the sides are in the ratio of 3:4:5.\n\nLet's denote the sides of the triangle as 3x, 4x, and 5x, where 5x is the hypotenuse. Since the hypotenuse is 18 cm, we have:\n\n5x = 18 cm\nx = 18 cm / 5\nx = 3.6 cm\n\nNow we can find the lengths of the other two sides:\n\nThe shorter side (opposite the 30-degree angle) is:\n3x = 3 * 3.6 cm = 10.8 cm\n\nThe longer side (adjacent to the 30-degree angle) is:\n4x = 4 * 3.6 cm = 14.4 cm\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = 10.8 cm + 14.4 cm + 18 cm = 43.2 cm\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the right-angled triangle is $\\boxed{43.2}$  cm."}

Furthermore, let the given side be $AD$. The given diagonal can be either $AC$ or $BD$, and for each possibility, the trapezoid - if it exists - is a solution to the problem. In both cases, only the roles of $AB$ and $CD$ are swapped in the construction, so it is sufficient to consider the case where the given segment is considered as the diagonal $AC$. In this case, the triangle $ACD$ can be constructed from its three sides. After constructing the midline $EF$ parallel to $DC$ (with $E$ on $AD$) and measuring $k$ from $E$ towards $F$, the endpoint will give the midpoint $G$ of the side $BC$. Thus, $B$ can be obtained as the intersection of the line through $A$ parallel to $DC$ and the line $CG$.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_e237a699199e0ada6f39g-1.jpg?height=398&width=669&top_left_y=473&top_left_x=717)\n\nThe quadrilateral $ABCD$ meets the conditions because the sides $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel to each other and to $EG$; $EG$ is indeed a midline because $AE = ED$, and its length is $k$; thus, $AB = 2k - \\frac{2k}{3} = \\frac{4k}{3}$, so $CD : AB = 1 : 2$; finally, $AD$ and $AC$ are equal to the given side and diagonal, respectively.\n\nThe condition for constructibility is that a triangle can be constructed from the side, the diagonal, and $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the midline (or $\\frac{4}{3}$ of the midline).\n\nThe two interpretations are independent; it is possible that there is a solution in one case but not in the other. (For example, if $k = 6$, the side is 5, and the diagonal is 10 units, then the diagonal can only be $BD$.)\n\nBéla Besenyei (Eger, Gárdonyi G. g. II. o. t.)\n\nRemarks. 1. Constructing $B$ is somewhat simpler if the segment $AB = 2CD$ is measured on the line through $A$ parallel to $DC$. This, however, makes the proof longer.\n\n2.

At most, it could be considered incomplete; the unconventional ambiguity was intentional.\n\n3. Many solutions lack the proof and discussion."}

Is it possible to construct an equilateral triangle with vertices at the grid points?\n\nb) In space, a regular grid of cubes is given. Is it possible to construct a regular tetrahedron with vertices coinciding with the grid points?", "answer": "proof", "solution": "37. a) Let \\(ABC\\) be any triangle, the vertices of which lie at the nodes of a grid.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_962b75a91b7185035ab9g-132.jpg?height=463&width=505&top_left_y=751&top_left_x=553)\n\nFig. 109. Consider a rectangle composed of grid squares, the sides of which pass through the vertices of triangle \\(ABC\\) (Fig. 109). Then the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is equal to the area of the rectangle minus the areas of three right-angled triangles, the hypotenuses of which are the sides of our triangle. The area of the rectangle and the areas of the right-angled triangles are rational numbers, since the length and width of the rectangle, as well as the lengths of the legs of the triangles, are integers (we take the side length of the grid square as the unit of measurement). Therefore, the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is a rational number.\n\nNow suppose that \\(ABC\\) is an equilateral triangle. Let the side length be \\(a\\). Then its area is \\(\\frac{a^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}\\). But \\(a\\) is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with integer legs. Therefore, \\(a^2\\) is an integer. Hence, \\(\\frac{a^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}\\) is an irrational number. We have shown that the area of the triangle is a rational number. Thus, there does not exist an equilateral triangle with vertices at the nodes of the grid.\n\nSecond solution. If the vertices of the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) were at the nodes of the grid, then (see Fig. 109)\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{tg} \\alpha = \\frac{DC}{DA}, \\quad \\operatorname{tg} \\beta = \\frac{BE}{EA}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(DC, DA, BE\\), and \\(EA\\) are integers, \\(\\operatorname{tg} \\alpha\\) and \\(\\operatorname{tg} \\beta\\) are rational numbers.\n\nLet\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{tg} \\alpha = m \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\operatorname{tg} \\beta = n\n\\]\n\n\\(\\angle BAC = 180^\\circ - \\alpha - \\beta = 60^\\circ\\), because triangle \\(ABC\\) is equilateral. Therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{tg} 60^\\circ = \\operatorname{tg}(180^\\circ - \\alpha - \\beta) = -\\operatorname{tg}(\\alpha + \\beta) = -\\frac{m + n}{1 - mn}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are rational numbers, \\(\\frac{m + n}{1 - mn}\\) is also a rational number.\n\nBut \\(\\operatorname{tg} 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3}\\) and is therefore an irrational number. The contradiction obtained shows that it is impossible to place an equilateral triangle in this manner.\n\nThird solution. Draw coordinate axes in the plane. Choose the vertex \\(B\\) of triangle \\(ABC\\) as the origin. Direct the \\(Ox\\) axis along one side of the square with vertex at \\(B\\), and the \\(Oy\\) axis along the other side of the square. Take the side length of the square as the unit of length.\n\nLet the vertex \\(A\\) have coordinates \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and the vertex \\(C\\) have coordinates \\(u\\) and \\(v\\); \\(x, y, u, v\\) are integers.\n\nThe length of side \\(AB\\) is \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\), the length of side \\(BC\\) is \\(\\sqrt{u^2 + v^2}\\), and from the right-angled triangle \\(ACD\\) we get that the length of side \\(AC\\) is \\(\\sqrt{(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2}\\). If triangle \\(ABC\\) is equilateral, then\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 = u^2 + v^2 = (x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2\n\\]\n\nWe can assume that in this equality the numbers \\(x, y, u, v\\) are coprime (with the greatest common divisor 1), because if they have a greatest common divisor different from 1, we can reduce all three parts of the equality by its square, and in the resulting equality the numbers \\(x, y, u, v\\) will be coprime. Therefore, we can assume that not all the numbers \\(x, y, u, v\\) are even. Further, from the equality \\(x^2 + y^2 = u^2 + v^2\\) it follows that either all four numbers \\(x, y, u, v\\) are odd, or one of the numbers \\(x, y\\) is even and the other is odd, and similarly one of the numbers \\(u, v\\) is even and the other is odd. In the first of these two cases, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nx = 2x_1 + 1, & u = 2u_1 + 1 \\\\\ny = 2y_1 + 1, & v = 2v_1 + 1\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nand, therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n4(x_1^2 + x_1 + y_1^2 + y_1) + 2 = 4(u_1^2 + u_1 + v_1^2 + v_1) + 2 = \\\\\n= 4(x_1 - u_1)^2 + 4(y_1 - v_1)^2\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\n\nthe first two expressions are not divisible by 4, while the third expression is divisible by 4, which is impossible.\n\nIn the second case, we have\n\n\\[\nx = 2x_1, \\quad y = 2y_1 + 1, \\quad u = 2u_1 \\quad v = 2v_1 + 1\n\\]\n\nand, therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n4(x_1^2 + y_1^2 + y_1) + 1 = 4(u_1^2 + v_1^2 + v_1) + 1 = \\\\\n= 4(x_1 - u_1)^2 + 4(y_1 - v_1)^2\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\n\nthe first two expressions are not divisible by 4, while the last one is divisible by 4, which is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, the case where \\(x\\) and \\(v\\) are even, and \\(y\\) and \\(u\\) are odd, is investigated.\n\nSince all cases turn out to be impossible, there do not exist integers \\(x, y, u, v\\) that satisfy the required equalities, and therefore there does not exist an equilateral triangle with vertices at the nodes of the grid.\nb) Consider an arbitrary cube with vertices at the nodes of the grid (Fig. 110). From one of its vertices, draw diagonals in all three adjacent faces and connect the second ends of these diagonals. Then the resulting lines will also be diagonals of the faces. These six lines will be the edges of a regular tetrahedron. Indeed, the number of faces of the resulting polyhedron is four, all its edges are equal as diagonals of equal squares, and all faces are equal equilateral triangles. From the equality of the planar angles of the trihedral angle, it follows that the trihedral angles themselves are also equal (the equality of the trihedral angles can also be shown directly by superimposing the cube on itself).\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_962b75a91b7185035ab9g-135.jpg?height=349&width=367&top_left_y=539&top_left_x=194)\n\nFig. 110."}
